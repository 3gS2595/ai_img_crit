Katy Grannan has taken a leap forward in her work.
Photographers and others like Katy Grannan, Daniela Rossell, Trisha Donnelly, and Francis Alÿs are finding ways around the arty discourse; collage and collectivism are ubiquitous; color is coming on like gangbusters; and all of it is happily happening across generational lines.
From private parts on figures in the work of Tracey Emin, Su-en Wong, Sarah Lucas, and Marlene McCarty to those in the photographs and self-portraits of Patti Chang, Malerie Marder, Katy Grannan, Kembra Pfahler, and Vanessa Beecroft, hairless pudenda are popping up in art galleries all over town.
Nevertheless, interesting artists emerged, including Katy Grannan, Malerie Marder, and one of our subjects, Justine Kurland.
