I kept wanting to see a Steve DiBenedetto or a Peter Doig—artists who noodle around to get what they want, who produce visual glitches, or whose surfaces are more organic and varied—or something as refined as an Agnes Martin or a Jim Nutt, or as fiercely intelligent, brilliantly intuitive, and aesthetically vulnerable as the new paintings of Jasper Johns.

Neither Schutz nor Bernhardt employs photographic tools, digital approaches, or outright appropriation in her work, in the manners of Peter Doig, Wilhelm Sasnal, and Luc Tuymans.
Making the sale all the more irritating, the market is now so distorted and tilted toward contemporary art that $14 million raised from the auction of a Monet is less than the cost of a large work by a contemporary art star like Gerhard Richter, Jeff Koons, Christopher Wool, Peter Doig, and many others.
In 1993 in London, he started publishing projects with then-unknown artists like Peter Doig, Elizabeth Peyton, Chris Ofili, and Jeremy Deller, among others, and went on to write well about art for ArtForum, among other places, and was then a director of exhibitions at London’s storied ICA (the place where Pop Art was actually born).
