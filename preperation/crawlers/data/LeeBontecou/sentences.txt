My favorite is the kinky combo of the hard oversize bed of Claes Oldenburg across from the vulval void of Lee Bontecou, which is next to Barry Le Va’s s/m installation of shattered glass and strewn felt.
And while almost every artist who emerged in the 1970s experimented with shaped paintings, Murray’s curving and hard-edged multi-paneled canvases make the most convincing argument I’ve ever seen for a painting being irregularly shaped, three-dimensional, bumpy, and filled with holes: more so than Frank Stella, whose work came first and is as garish but who isn’t as interested in how his surfaces are painted, or Lee Bontecou, who came before that, but never really painted her shapes.
This biennial might have twinkled more had the curators switched a few of the big names for slightly less predictable big names: Mary Heilmann instead of Robert Mangold, Jim Nutt rather than David Hockney, William Eggleston instead of Jack Pierson, Lee Bontecou rather than Alex Hay, and R. Crumb and Cady Noland instead of Paul McCarthy and Richard Prince.
It might lay dormant for generations, as in the case of Florine Stettheimer or Lee Bontecou.
And while he was among the first to hail artists like Yayoi Kusama and Lee Bontecou, his reviews could be scorching.
In all of this I see ways paved for artists like Yayoi Kusama, Louise Bourgeois, Lee Bontecou, Francesca Woodman, and many more.
There was a marvelous exhibition of Lee Bontecou, as well as shows devoted to Marina Abramovic, the women of Fluxus, and the films of Maya Deren.
There should be rooms of Alice Neel, Georgia O’Keefe, Lee Bontecou, Arthur Dove, Stuart Davis, Arshile Gorky, and Paul Cadmus.
Lynda Benglis ties canvas in knots, Jackie Winsor lashes logs together with twine to make a Paleolithic stretcher, Dorothea Rockburne creates chipboard grids (a Rockburne survey is overdue), and Lee Bontecou quite simply presents what looks like the mouth of hell, the eye of a Cyclops, the surface of the moon, and a vagina dentata in a relief painting that still has the power to terrify, entice, and awe.

In the 1960s, Donald Judd, one of the greatest art critics of the era, wrote that Lee Bontecou's three-dimensional forms and hell-holes were "explicit and powerful;" had "a primitive, oppressive.
