The results are obscure, but you can discern vestiges of those huge, boxy structures (i.e., Home Depots and Wal-Marts) that render the American landscape, in the words of Rem Koolhaas, “a low-grade purgatory”—buildings that are closer to wavelengths than to architecture.
“Architecture Hot and Cold,” organized by Terence Riley, chief curator of architecture and design, is corny, but its obsessive overcrowding of images of buildings by everyone from R. Buckminster Fuller and Andreas Gursky to Rem Koolhaas and Toba Khedoori is hysterical and invigorating—even if you can’t look at any one thing.

He excelled at portraying the border-to-border, edgeless hum and busy obliviousness of modern life, what Francis Fukuyama ridiculously declared “the end of history,” George W.S. Trow called “The Context of No Context,” and Rem Koolhaas dubbed “Junkspace”.
