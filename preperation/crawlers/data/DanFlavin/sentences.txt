Koh’s installation lacks the experimentalism and rigor of Matta-Clark, the beauty and directness of Dan Flavin, and the depth of James Turrell.
Except it was a group show and a number of big-gun artists flew into a rage, including Donald Judd, who lambasted Buren as “a paperhanger” and an “outlaw,” and Dan Flavin (whose own work interfered with that of others, but never mind), who referred to him as “little Buren,” xenophobically dismissing his “French drapery” as “a ruthless negative gesture intended to advance his marginal career”.
Initially, these wall works, which look like mathematical theorems illustrated by Dan Flavin, are sexy and incisive.
Ryman’s doggedness to this one thing makes him the avatar of the subgenre of white paintings as surely as Dan Flavin is of fluorescent.
Indeed, De Maria made a swastika made of shiny metal troughs; Frank Stella named a work Arbeit Macht Frei (“Work Makes You Free,” the slogan over the gates of Auschwitz); Morris created cages and famously posed shirtless wearing a Nazi helmet; Judd said he was interested in “plain power”; Dan Flavin even referred to an erection when using the phrase “diagonal of personal ecstasy” to describe one of his fluorescent-light sculptures.
Among other early outstanding works on view is a great light piece by Dan Flavin — one from his famous Monument for V. Tatlin series from 1969 — and excellent photographs by Robert Adams, Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, Larry Clark, and Cindy Sherman, including five early Filmstills.

On the one hand, he pushed these technologies beyond their limits in amazing ways, establishing a signature open way of making paintings that proceeded from artists like Reinhardt, Kelly, Warhol, Robert Morris, Dan Flavin, Christopher Wool, and the Pictures Art crowd.
He coined the term specific object to describe his work and that of friends like Dan Flavin and John Chamberlain.
Employing Microsoft Word, desktop computers, Adobe Photoshop, bitmapped files, UltraChrome and DuraBrite inkjet on linen, book pages, exhibition invitations, and plywood, Guyton has arrived at something as powerful, albeit more subtle, yet as enticing as Dan Flavin’s fluorescent lights.
A year after opening its gigantic new exhibition facilities in Beacon, intended to house a generation of artists like Judd, Dan Flavin, John Chamberlain, and Richard Serra, Dia shut down the 22nd Street building.
His marbled sweeps and sluices of high-key color, his clashing dissolves and blends of flecked, blazing paint, his erasure of spatial demarcations, and his radiance make him the most purely optical postwar artist since Dan Flavin, and one of the greatest painters alive.
It’s like an upside-down Walter De Maria or Dan Flavin piece.

Next, the museum removed Daniel Burens 66 x 32 foot stripped banner-painting from the main rotunda after artists (including Dan Flavin and Donald Judd) vehemently protested that Burens work interfered with theirs.
