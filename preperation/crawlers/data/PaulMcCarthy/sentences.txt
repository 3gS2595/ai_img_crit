There’s also the corner with Mary Kelly’s pregnant belly as a Sol LeWitt–like grid with implications of the birth canal delivered via Nauman’s nearby narrow-corridor video; and the abject-meets-the-Apollonian alcove of Louise Bourgeois, Sue Williams, Carroll Dunham, and Paul McCarthy.
Paul McCarthy, Martin Kippenberger and Jorg Immendorf each turn up twice.
Recent male mess makers include Jason Rhoades, Damien Hirst, Keith Tyson, John Bock, Jonathan Meese, Aidas Bareikis, Thomas Hirschhorn, the late Dieter Roth and Martin Kippenberger, and the living overlord, Paul McCarthy.
In “Renegaten,” he deploys his usual cast of artists, workers, wanderers, jugglers, and the burly Viking that curator Laura Hoptman calls a “Paul McCarthy character” who carries a sausage sporting the word solution.
Gary Hume, Robert Melee, Martin Kippenberger, Olaf Breuning, Paul McCarthy, Tracey Emin, and Damien Hirst fit this mold.
In addition to the multiple love handles of Paul McCarthy and the geezerliness of John Coplans, there are the pigeon toes, knock-knees, and chunky thighs of that Keith Richards-Johnny Cash-Quasimodo of the art world, our own Man in Black, Vito Acconci.
The first is that too many artists are present without affecting the exhibition much (e.g., Andrea Bowers, Laylah Ali, Robert Mangold, Sam Durant, Robyn O’Neil, Cory Arcangel/BEIGE, Terence Koh, Taylor Davis, Hockney, and, I’m afraid, Cattelan, and Paul McCarthy’s towering inflatable on the roof).
This biennial might have twinkled more had the curators switched a few of the big names for slightly less predictable big names: Mary Heilmann instead of Robert Mangold, Jim Nutt rather than David Hockney, William Eggleston instead of Jack Pierson, Lee Bontecou rather than Alex Hay, and R. Crumb and Cady Noland instead of Paul McCarthy and Richard Prince.
Forerunners to the present moment include Cady Noland, Karen Kilimnik, Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Paul McCarthy, and the abject art of the early ’90s.
To his credit, Melee melds the bad taste and impudence of John Waters, the messiness of Paul McCarthy, a schizzy version of early-’90s pathetic aesthetic, a lot of raunch, a touch of madness, and a dash of Eminem’s ire.
More recently, there’s R. Crumb, Paul Thek, Sean Landers, Paul McCarthy, Tracey Emin—though I like the idea of her work more than the work—maybe the Chapmans and Vito Acconci, and certainly the late greats Dieter Roth and Jack Smith.
I went to RISD, and when I was there, I realized that so many of my favorite artists — Douglas Gordon, Paul McCarthy, Cindy Sherman — were, a lot of the time, making work that was incorporating aspects of the film world.
Magpie-eyed artist Jim Shaw has spent most of his career in the shadows of his good friends and colleagues Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy.
With nothing much to say about how tepid the factory is as an artistic gesture or how it might be different from similar set ups by Paul McCarthy, Dieter Roth, and Santiago Sierra, and with no paintings or sculpture on hand, I brought Murillo’s candy to our crack staff at Grub Street to let them have a taste and tell me what is being made inside this bad installation.
This season, Paul McCarthy’s hall-filling installation included a giant artificial forest, multiple stage sets, and videos featuring actors playing Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs, and Walt Disney—all in various stages of utter debauchery.
Paul McCarthy’s building-filling video and sculptural installation at the Park Avenue Armory opened last night.
His group shows are extraordinarily far-reaching, among them the landmark “Helter Skelter,” which in 1992 looked at the dark side of the Golden State, and featured artists like Mike Kelley, Paul McCarthy, Charles Ray, and Llyn Foulkes, who is only now becoming widely recognized.
Kelley, a Detroit native, spent his whole career in Los Angeles, where — with Raymond Pettibon, Paul McCarthy, Catherine Opie, Jennifer Pastor, Charles Ray, and Jason Rhodes — he helped turn the incipient foreboding of Edward Kienholz, Ed Ruscha, Nancy Rubins, and Chris Burden into an all-out acrimonious art of darkness.
Until 2005, the trio staged fabulous or head-scratching pop-up shows: Adam McEwan’s sign that said “Fuck Off We’re Closed,” Elizabeth Peyton’s large portrait-on-glass of Napoleon for Valentine’s Day, Paul McCarthy’s enormous Santa Butt Plug decorated with excrement, and Pawel Althamer’s piece in which he hired Polish illegal immigrants to smash the glass with a baseball bat every Saturday.
But that coastal divide provided a canyon-size aesthetic opening, freeing up artists like Ed Ruscha, Bruce Nauman, Paul McCarthy, and Baldessari, all of whom developed styles vastly different from those in the East.
But, overall, there’s too much junk: Matt Greene’s amateurish paintings, and sculptures by Takashi Murakami, Paul McCarthy, and Tim Noble and Sue Webster.
I am thinking of Paul McCarthy’s excremental installations, Peter Saul’s twisted painted figures penetrating one another, Kara Walker’s race wars of sex and violence, and the Nazis in hell of Jake and Dinos Chapman, art that almost seems too much to take or even to look at, that resists aesthetic metabolism, that exudes a sort of poetics of apotheosis.
Trecartin is a combination of Jack Smith, Paul McCarthy, Taylor Mead, a drag show, daytime soap operas, and the Home Shopping Network.
