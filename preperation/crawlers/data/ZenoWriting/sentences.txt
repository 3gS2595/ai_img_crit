It consists of one 11-minute film, titled Zeno Writing, and 60 works on paper.
Until I saw Zeno Writing, which premiered at last summer’s Documenta XI, I thought that even if they were about weather, landscapes, or only elephants—if he were merely to tell the story of a shopkeeper, and not apartheid—Kentridge’s films would still entice.
In Zeno Writing, which is based on a 1923 short story by Italo Svevo, Kentridge employs his familiar vocabulary of torn-paper silhouettes and archival footage, but he abandons his apartheid story and the cast of characters he told it through.
Zeno Writing casts a disquieting light on his previous work, and is flawed in ways that are both hackneyed and mawkish.
But the melodrama and pretentiousness of Festivalism are unmistakable in Zeno Writing.
