Sara J. really brings it again, this week in captivating watercolors.
Sara J. totally finds her sculptural groove, transforming cotton and the exhaust system into a Brancusi-like abstract-primitive-mechanistic fetish.
But Sara J. takes home the prize, for the otherness of her exhaust pipes from an archaic, preindustrial society.
Lola snips at Kymia, who grouses about Lola to Sarah K., who says “Lola is one of those people I stay away from” as Lola and Michelle side against Kymia who starts crying as Sara J. complains about Michelle and Lola who call Sara J. “a worrywart”.
Sara J. can’t go to grad school without the dough.
Sara J. longingly quips, “Young, will you massage my vagina?
” Wow—Sara J. has game!
Sara J. and Kymia create a fine painting of an alien creature pulling a tree.
This is the second week in a row I’m put off by something emotionally impervious about Sara J., who reasons, “I’m a Cancer, and Cancers are emotional”.
