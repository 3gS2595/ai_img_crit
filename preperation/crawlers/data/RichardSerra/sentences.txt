Lefcourt’s paintings are blacker than Ad Reinhardt’s, as dense as Richard Serra’s drawings, and intermittently as mesmerizing as Vija Celmins’s starscapes.
The current, admittedly impermanent but nevertheless desultory arrangement of the art of this period in the museum’s gleaming second-floor galleries—a space so high-ceilinged and immense that it feels as if it were designed with Richard Serra in mind—is so lackluster that it makes you wonder how this institution views itself.
Yet while fellow post-minimalists like Richard Serra, Bruce Nauman, and Richard Tuttle, among others, developed and extended the intrinsic characteristics of their work—Serra his power, Nauman his skepticism, and Tuttle his quirky urgency—Sonnier was either unable or unwilling to evolve his essences, which turned out to be joy and atmosphere.
As Matthew Barney plumbs the mystic depths of his own inner kingdom, Schneider explores anxiety—so remarkably that curator Massimiliano Gioni dubbed him “the Richard Serra of fear”.
The sculpture is big, bulky, vaguely imposing, but ultimately inert, Ann Hamilton and Richard Serra by way of Arte Povera.
Staging a circus-like event in this conspicuously circus-like environment can’t help but make you think of alpha males like Richard Serra, Anselm Kiefer, Damien Hirst, and Julian Schnabel, all of whom have thrown their weight around this same space.
It touches on Freemasonry, Celtic mythology, and the lost tribes of Israel; ranges in time between 1874, the year of Harry Houdini’s birth, and 1977, the year murderer Gary Gilmore was executed; has a Rubens-meets-Cronenberg feel for the flesh; and features Ursula Andress, Norman Mailer, and Richard Serra, the last of whom Barney oedipally kills before being killed himself by no less a phallic character than the Chrysler Building (you’ll see).
We’ve gone from drawing as a “verb,” as Richard Serra called it in 1977—referring to art that is primarily about process, materials, surfaces, or tools—to drawing that is essentially a noun, a finished, stand-alone product.
Carl Ostendarp and Cary Leibowitz, both currently attempting comebacks, had shows up, as did Richard Serra, whose huge sculptures filled Gagosian, just as they do today.

The two pictures are like a Richard Serra sculpture, without edges or surface, two massive slabs of imposing light.

Yet every detail seems considered, touched by his mind — as Richard Serra said, “executed to millimeter perfection”.
Richard Serra threw molten lead at the wall.
Formally, the work resembles large-scale Robert Smithson, Mel Bochner, or Richard Serra charcoal drawings, but Kim uses her graphs and words to record degrees of her fury — from “acute rage” to “legit rage” to “full on rage” — at there being no interpreters at meetings and fake interpreters on TV, at her family not learning sign language, at fast-food cashiers, at airplane movies without captions, at Uber drivers’ calling rather than texting, and so much more that your heart will break.
Even before reading Büchel’s proposal, I could see that these eight looming prototypes looked exactly like minimalistic works of sculpture and environmental interventions made by artists like Richard Serra, Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, Maya Lin, Walter De Maria, Nancy Holt, Donald Judd, James Turrell, Michael Heizer, Tony Smith, and many others.
Maya Lin; Ebb and Flow Pace 537 W. 24th Street / through October 7I was very wrong to think that when Lin’s Vietnam Memorial was dedicated in Washington D.C., in 1983, that it was primarily derivative of Richard Serra — in fact, I see now she was able to make one of the most suspect phenomena in America (formalist geometric abstraction) tell stories of valor, love, loss, and offer balm to generations.
The same things were true of artists like Julian Schnabel, Richard Prince, Donald Judd, and Richard Serra, to say nothing of Warhol’s wonderful profligatism.
Now I see Barney as a mystic bridge between the ambition, absurdity, first-person identity politics, and pseudo-autobiographical Arabian Nights fiction of 1980s artists like Cindy Sherman, Robert Gober, Anselm Kiefer, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Martin Kippenberger and the populism, love of beauty, craft, dexterity with scales large and small, unusual materials, and grand activism of 1990s artists like Kara Walker, Pipilotti Rist, Olafur Eliasson, Thomas Hirschhorn, later Robert Gober, and even Richard Serra — who actually appeared in one of Barney’s films.
Fast-forward to the postwar period, and the story is the same: Think of the grandiose universality of Mark Rothko’s Abstract Expressionism or Richard Serra’s and Carl Andre’s materialistic minimalisms.
“It seems like a waste to do the 1,000th Richard Serra show or whatever,” he says.
I think all the roads of bad public art and, as a result, this new terrible public space lead to 1979, and to the Government Services Administration commissioning Richard Serra’s tremendous Tilted Arc.
Richard Serra: “Equal” David Zwirner 537 W. 20th St., through July 24 By now it’s not unusual when confronting one of Richard Serra’s gigantic, metrically menacing, magnetically mighty curving steel sculptures, which are simultaneously architectonic and geological, to walk all around its meandering curves, maybe spot lovers kissing in the center of one, look at it in utter awe, yawn, and say, “Great!
Instead, I beheld something more powerful than a Richard Serra — a massive slab of white-veined marble on the floor beneath an enormous painting suspended from the ceiling — like a flat, artificial cloud over something enormously heavy.
Paintings are hung salon-style, wedged in, given attenuated spaces and little bins, or installed near the top of tall walls meant only for showing the work of Richard Serra.
Matt Connors, whom I’m usually not a fan of and who is the show’s token Zombie Formalist, looks fantastic here with a gigantic, leaning three-panel painting that is Ellsworth Kelly and Brice Marden made by Richard Serra.
The “show” is a sky-blue mini-double-decker van with the faces of art-world movers and shakers, like Marina Abramovic, Klaus Biesenbach (saying “I do not like it”), Richard Serra, Larry Gagosian, and Jeff Koons.
A good Koons essay and a batch of great artist-commentaries on Koons run alongside the usual abstruse articles telling us that cinema and performance and photography are now very, very, important to art, eight pages on Richard Serra’s latest man-of-steel slabs in the Qatar desert, the requisite review of a big international biennial, pages and pages about a silent film from 1930, and reviews where convoluted jargon makes it hard to know what the critic thinks of the work.
(Don’t worry about Richard Serra; he can take care of himself.
Guyton has gone the full Richard Serra with this show: five gigantic new ink-on-stretched-linen paintings, each nine feet high, made by twice feeding the folded material through a printer, once for the top half, once for the bottom.
The work equaled Richard Serra’s in physicality, disequilibrium, and room-filling power.
As does Cinthia Marcelle’s video of a street strewn with buckets, crates, fluorescent tubes, tires, and all manner of thrown debris—a meeting of abstraction, scatter art, Jackson Pollock, Richard Serra’s molten lead, Fischli-Weiss, and Tahrir Square.
Barney’s primitive, gluteal masses conjure alpha artists and romantics like Joseph Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, Cy Twombly, Richard Serra, and Julian Schnabel, as well as newcomers like Sterling Ruby and Jessica Jackson Hutchins (who once-upon-an-art-school may have been influenced by Barney).

I skipped some art in which New York itself figured prominently—I hated Christo’s The Gates, and I didn’t like Richard Serra’s Tilted Arc either—and instead chose artists who threw New York curves, who changed the context of making art here.
It’s Old Testament art history: In the beginning there was Cézanne who begat Picasso and Matisse who begat all the way down the line to Pollock who begat MoMA’s most recent alpha male, Richard Serra.
