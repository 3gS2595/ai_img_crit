This useful term, coined in the mid 1990s by the French art critic Nicolas Bourriaud, was meant to describe the then groundbreaking practices of artists like Rirkrit Tiravanija, Philippe Parreno, Pierre Huyghe, Liam Gillick, Vanessa Beecroft, and others whose work often involved what Bourriaud called “connectivity” and “interactivity”.
Also, don’t miss the terrific videos by Francesco Vezzoli, Cameron Jamie, Pierre Huyghe, the collective Don’t Trust Anyone Over Thirty, and especially Ryan Trecartin’s retina-bursting all-pores-open A Family Finds Entertainment.

) for weirder, more visionary ones like Verne Dawson, Ricci Albenda, Dana Schutz, Trisha Donnelly, Anna Gaskell, Lisa Ruyter, Robert Melee, Benjamin Butler, Jonathan Horowitz, Guy Richards Smit, Steve DiBenedetto, Jon Kessler and Paul Chan, or (even though I’m not a fan of all of them) Pierre Huyghe, Takashi Murakami, William Kentridge, Rudolf Stingel, Urs Fisher, Jim Lambie, Vanessa Beecroft, Douglas Gordon, Ugo Rondinoni and Francis Alÿs—all of whom live part-time in the United States.

Also, dont miss the terrific videos by Francesco Vezzoli (shallow and slutty but ambitious and riveting), Cameron Jamie (its real and intense not staged), Pierre Huyghe (its staged not real), the collective "Dont Trust Anyone Over Thirty" (by artists beyond said age), and especially Ryan Trecartins retina-bursting all-pours-open A Family Finds Entertainment (the best work by an unknown artist in the show, and probably the craziest).
