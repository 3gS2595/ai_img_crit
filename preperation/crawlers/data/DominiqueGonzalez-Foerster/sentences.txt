Among many notable artists who exhibited very early in their careers here and who were introduced to audiences by Spellman are Andreas Gursky, Thomas Ruff, Thomas Demand, Rodney Graham, Karen Kilimnik, Collier Schorr, Doug Aitken, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Mike Nelson, Rob Pruitt and Jack Early, Jane and Louise Wilson, Maureen Gallace, John Dogg, and Richard Prince.
There’s one week to go, with events by artists Mike Kelley, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Terence Koh, and Marina Rosenfeld on the lineup, and I’m nearly overwhelmed already.
Tiravanija’s comfy video lounge, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster’s sonic rain forest, Douglas Gordon’s wall texts, Liam Gillick’s S-shaped benches, Philippe Parreno’s lighted marquee, and Angela Bulloch’s LED night sky are all okay.
Among many standouts, however, are Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster’s petting-zoo-like installation of scaled-down works of other Münster artists, Mike Kelley’s actual petting zoo, Hans-Peter Feldmann’s sprucing up of two public restrooms, Guy Ben-Ner’s reconstructed bicycle project, Susan Philipsz’s haunting recorded aria under a bridge, and Pawel Althamer’s winding path through parks and fields.
