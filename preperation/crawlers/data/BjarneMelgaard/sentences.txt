Brock Enright’s kidnapping piece is incredibly annoying but intense; Cameron Jamie is better than this work indicates; ditto Bjarne Melgaard; Matt Greene’s Spanish-moss-like paintings are overly familiar and underdeveloped; and I’m still trying to figure out if Banks Violette is more than a latter-day Robert Longo.
I’m thinking, for example, of the blasted-looking abstract paintings of Lucy Dodd; the scorching color and rash repeating orders of Katherine Bernhardt; the erratic organization and Eros of Keltie Ferris; the maybe-too-pretty but hobbled Modernism of Patricia Treib; the all-out discontentedness and retinal attack of Bjarne Melgaard; the insane glutted flat surfaces of Borna Sammak.
Among the very impressive work included is a fabulous Day-Glo painting that turns into a face that turns into a magic spell by newcomer Austin Lee (who debuted to such excellent effect at Postmasters last season), some small-scale gaudy beauties by Bjarne Melgaard, a wonder sculpture in the window by Theo Rosenblum, some recent wild-style knockouts by Katherine Bernhardt (who has been killing it every time out of late), and, most intriguing, a wall of Greek ceramic-painting style meets Japanese anime meets something two-dimensional and monstrous by Giovanni Garcia-Fenech, whose work I hadn’t seen but now yen to see more of, soon.
In January, artist Bjarne Melgaard was attacked by people in the art world as racist for a reprise of an iconic pop work, in this case, a black woman in the shape of a chair.

”You could mistake the work of the ­Norwegian-bred New York artist Bjarne Melgaard, who describes himself as “a 45-year-old worn-out faggot,” for more of the same old bad-boy stuff.
Bjarne Melgaard, at Ramiken CrucibleMelgaard followed up a triumphant 2011 group show with a fantastic array of outsider and insider artists, as well as those caged tigers.
At Maccarone, I gasped at one of the best shows of 2011, Bjarne Melgaard’s “After Shelley Duvall ’72 (Frogs on the High Line),” a raucous exhibition of work by insiders, outsiders, and other geniuses, jammed together and teeming with anger and ideas.
“The Social ­Failure,” at Maccarone Curator Bjarne Melgaard created the best installation in last summer’s Venice Biennale, Beyond Death: ­Viral Discontents and Contemporary Notions About AIDS, and followed it with this wildly untamed exhibition and journey into pleasure, pain, abjection, and what one visitor called “the failures of heterosexuality”.
