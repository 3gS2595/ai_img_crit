Sometimes I think von Heyl is just a late entry in the de Kooning sweepstakes (one of her current paintings is even titled Woman).
In all of von Heyl’s work your eyes do a circuitous dance, traversing stippled, scrubbed, and stained surfaces, crossing patches of almost bare canvas, exploring what looks like photographic space, and following reedy streams of fleecy pigment laid down with rags, washcloths, and sticks.
As seen in this dual English-and-German volume, it’s no wonder that von Heyl is admired as an “artist’s artist” — someone infinitely admired by fellow practitioners.
While the optical power in her work, her wild imagery and color, even helped free artists who were her elders — able painters like von Heyl, Humphries, Amy Sillman, and many others — Schutz was cast as a “market artist,” somehow not part of the art community.

This varies the internal speed of von Heyl's work.
