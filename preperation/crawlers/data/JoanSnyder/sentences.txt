Over the last 30 years, women who have painted in this more flamboyant way have included Joan Mitchell, Joan Snyder, and Louise Fishman.
There’s not a single canvas by Julian Schnabel, David Salle, Elizabeth Murray, Eric Fischl, Terry Winters, Joan Snyder, Lari Pittman, Carroll Dunham, Peter Halley, or Philip Taaffe.
There’s a Brice Marden here, an Agnes Martin there; Jonathan Borofsky, Joel Shapiro, Joan Snyder, and Ellsworth Kelly pop up, as do Cézanne, Corot, Mondrian, and Grandma Moses.
Honorable mentions: I could easily go on about the Chelsea shows of Lily van der Stokker, Casey Cook, Deborah Kass, and the ever-young 70-year-old Joan Snyder at Betty Cuningham, who’s doing what she’s done for decades, only better than ever.
