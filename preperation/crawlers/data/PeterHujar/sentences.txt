Here, don’t miss Peter Hujar, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Nan Goldin, and David Wojnarowicz.
His art brings together the three dominant strains of the ’80s: neo-expressionism, photo appropriation, and graffiti, tempered by the intensely sexual, almost classical, no-nonsense photography of his friend, mentor, and onetime lover, Peter Hujar.
On January 3, 1987, Peter Hujar was diagnosed as suffering from pneumocystis pneumonia and AIDS.
In 1987, the filmmaker and artist David Wojnarowicz captures in film and photographs the death of his lover, Peter Hujar.
Friend of Julian Schnabel, Jeff Koons, Nan Goldin, Francesco Clemente, Peter Hujar, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Leonardo DiCaprio, Lil’ Kim, Chloë Sevigny, Miuccia Prada, Sean Penn, Helmut Lang, Todd Solondz, k.d. lang, Valentino, and Veronica Webb, and nurturer and torturer of gifted writers like Rene Ricard and Lisa Liebmann, this Sarah Lawrence graduate was a poster child for the unbridled desire of the 1980s, its creative pretentiousness in its very best and most crazy forms, the one who helped integrate underground, mainstream, fashion, rock ‘n’ roll, and anyone who showed up and tried to make a connection.
