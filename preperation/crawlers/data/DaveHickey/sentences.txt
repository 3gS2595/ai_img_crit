MOCA; Kathy Halbreich, director of the Walker Art Center; Thelma Golden, deputy director of the Studio Museum; Philadelphia Museum director Anne d’Harnoncourt; peripatetic international curating machine and Antonin Artaud look-alike Hans-Ulrich Obrist; and Dave Hickey, who wears his curator’s hat with the same rebel abandon he dons his critic’s hat.
