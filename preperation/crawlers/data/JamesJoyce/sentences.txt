For his powerful, almost anonymous outing at White Columns, Portland-based Harrell Fletcher, a quiet strong point in the 2004 Whitney Biennial with his video project of a group of mechanics and their customers reading snippets of James Joyce’s Ulysses, has installed 90 images he made with a digital camera of the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon).
I also really liked Dave Muller’s wall, Erick Swenson’s elegant deer, Harrell Fletcher’s James Joyce video, Andrea Zittel’s kooky study center, Emily Jacir’s Palestinian project, Aïda Ruilova’s bombarding video snippets, the extraordinary music of Antony and the Johnsons, Eve Sussman’s video Velázquez, Deborah Stratman’s film in the Simparch installation, Marina Abramovic’s poignant video, Jim Hodges, Spencer Finch, Yutaka Sone, Catherine Sullivan, and the best yet Central Park sculpture installations.
It’s like James Joyce in A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man.
(Although this is not to say that protest is always the bourgeois against the libertine — there have been protests against the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, rap, rock-and-roll, James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, Andres Serrano, or Chris Ofili’s Holy Virgin Mary.

There’s a good chance you’ll have some of those feelings, as well as a guttural jolt of what James Joyce called the nightmare of history, in Kara Walker’s bitterly beautiful, psychically naked, carnal charnel house of a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
