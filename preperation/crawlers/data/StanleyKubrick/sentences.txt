Unfortunately there’s also a lot of unprocessed references to and borrowings from Bill Viola, Matthew Barney, Sharon Lockhart, Stanley Kubrick, New Wave Cinema, Shirin Neshat, Star Trek, and The Twilight Zone.
Stanley Kubrick’s seminal 1968 sci-fi epic tracing the evolution of man from prehistory to the future — apes to astronauts — was a groundbreaking film for the sci-fi genre, for special effects, and for elliptical storytelling: All those lengthy scenes of spaceships slowly docking to stately classical music were arguably just as important as more typically plot-oriented scenes (to the extent that there were any).
It’s an “I am Spartacus” move—and we should remember that, in Stanley Kubrick’s 1960 film, the Roman general Crassus promises not to punish the slaves if they will betray their leader, and once they step forward, he crucifies them all.
