Second, it traces Fraser’s knotty trajectory from being an appropriation artist who, however competent, veered too close to tropes already in use by artists like Louise Lawler, Sherrie Levine, Richard Prince, Martha Rosler, and Adrian Piper, to becoming an intermittently singular maker of something abberant, deeper, and complicated.
Recently, Elaine Sturtevant, Richard Pettibone, Richard Prince, and Sherrie Levine have made renditions of other artists’ works.
In the handy pamphlet accompanying the show, Durant says he wants to “move monuments commemorating lives lost during the Indian Wars to the National Mall in Washington, D.C.” This idea is pointed without being preachy, heartrending but not mawkish, and politically incisive if stylistically indebted to artists like Sherrie Levine, Rachel Whiteread, Lothar Baumgarten, Stephen Prina, Allan McCollum, and Sol LeWitt.
Sussman’s video Velázquez extends a ploy that’s been around since Duchamp drew a mustache on a reproduction of the Mona Lisa and Sherrie Levine made watercolors of modernist icons.
If it weren’t, we’d all still think Jim Dine or Sherrie Levine were worth looking at.
Later, Sherrie Levine, who is in the show, said, “I always liked those paintings”.
Some people manage to look striking: Elaine de Kooning with her cigarette; Sherrie Levine, the only one in sunglasses; David Hammons in the manner of a street prophet; Agnes Martin as our Gertrude Stein; artist Mike Sale in a dog collar; and Jack Pierson shirtless.
Look carefully at Carissa Rodriguez’s handsome silent film of tony interiors and sculptures by Constantin Brancusi as it morphs into a filmic Louise Lawler exploration of various rich collectors who own editions of the same Sherrie Levine–appropriated Brancusi sculpture; The Maid, as the work is titled, becomes riveting in its insinuation of cookie-cutter collector taste and what goes into maintaining this system of wealth and accumulation.
Thus all the formal echoes of Rauschenberg and the dematerializing of the art object of post-minimalist sculpture; Jessica Stockholder and Cady Noland’s notions of object-based installation; and numerous references to Pictures artists like Gretchen Bender, Sherrie Levine, and Cindy Sherman.
Indeed, the ’80s come off the best here, with three good Gobers, especially the tremendous 1985 Ascending Sink, which reverberates with more inscrutable pathos than ever, handfuls of strong Richard Prince pictures, wonderful Sherrie Levine watercolors, and a few lesser-known Jeff Koons pieces.
She and her female contemporaries (Louise Lawler, Sherrie Levine, Barbara Kruger, Laurie Simmons, and a few others) “weren’t accepted in the guys’ world, so we found this whole other way to create”.
Sherrie Levine’s tightly controlled, academically stringent, sometimes stultifying survey at the Whitney Museum of American Art shows how one artist from this generation cross-examined art history, reveled in it, and smashed it against the windshield of her anger.
Sarah Charlesworth tore up magazines to show us why we desired what we desired; Louise Lawler was a spy in the house of art, taking pictures of work by male artists installed in posh collections; Laurie Simmons created sicko domestic interiors; Barbara Kruger performed shock therapy on advertising; Sherrie Levine, who said, “Appropriation is not all that different from wanting to appropriate your father’s wife or your mother’s husband,” rephotographed famous photographs.

The "Pictures" exhibition at Artist Space, curated by Douglas Crimp, with artists Troy Brauntuch, Jack Goldstein, Sherrie Levine, Robert Longo and Philip Smith, signaled a change in artistic atmosphere to a more theoretical, cerebral, critical approach.
She is soon joined by Sherrie Levine.
