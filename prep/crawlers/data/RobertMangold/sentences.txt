Like Agnes Martin or Robert Mangold, he sets up very narrow parameters, then explores them doggedly.
The first is that too many artists are present without affecting the exhibition much (e.g., Andrea Bowers, Laylah Ali, Robert Mangold, Sam Durant, Robyn O’Neil, Cory Arcangel/BEIGE, Terence Koh, Taylor Davis, Hockney, and, I’m afraid, Cattelan, and Paul McCarthy’s towering inflatable on the roof).
This biennial might have twinkled more had the curators switched a few of the big names for slightly less predictable big names: Mary Heilmann instead of Robert Mangold, Jim Nutt rather than David Hockney, William Eggleston instead of Jack Pierson, Lee Bontecou rather than Alex Hay, and R. Crumb and Cady Noland instead of Paul McCarthy and Richard Prince.
He combines this with the next-to-nothingness of Richard Tuttle’s almost-abstractions and the flat, shaped monochromes of Robert Mangold.
Not far from there, seven different-colored geometric shapes, each on a white ground, by Russian Ivan Kliun radiate calibration and nuanced surface, and point directly to artists like Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin, and Robert Mangold.
The cover of the New York Times Magazine features Pace art dealer Arnold Glimcher with his so-called "art world all-stars," all middle-aged white men, including John Chamberlain, Donald Judd, Chick Close, Robert Mangold, Joel Shapiro, Robert Ryman, George Condo and the over-the-hill Jim Dine.
