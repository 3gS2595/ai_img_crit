This biennial might have twinkled more had the curators switched a few of the big names for slightly less predictable big names: Mary Heilmann instead of Robert Mangold, Jim Nutt rather than David Hockney, William Eggleston instead of Jack Pierson, Lee Bontecou rather than Alex Hay, and R. Crumb and Cady Noland instead of Paul McCarthy and Richard Prince.
When looking at Nutt’s small-scale, wispy drawings and opalescent paintings, imagine Ingres and Mirò getting together with Arshile Gorky and Saul Steinberg to render a race of extraterrestrial Kabuki actors or intergalactic film noir actresses; or Cranach, Klee, H.C. Westermann, and R. Crumb drawing the refined gentlewomen of Flatland.
This connects them to a number of graphic whizzes (e.g., Keegan McHargue, Matt Leines, Yuri Masnyj, Xylor Jane, Erik Parker, and Anthony Burdin), some of whom are taking cues from renegades like R. Crumb, Chris Johanson, and Barry McGee, as well as street prophets and tattooists.
More recently, there’s R. Crumb, Paul Thek, Sean Landers, Paul McCarthy, Tracey Emin—though I like the idea of her work more than the work—maybe the Chapmans and Vito Acconci, and certainly the late greats Dieter Roth and Jack Smith.
And where’s R. Crumb?
Landers says these works were inspired by Magritte’s paintings of the late 1940s, but they’re oddly reminiscent of the early clown portraits of George Condo, as well as thrift-store art, and the keep-on-truckin’ cartooning of R. Crumb.
In this show, Williams is evincing his familiar influences and visual kin, artists like Guston, Bonnard, Vuillard, Peter Saul, and R. Crumb, plus some Chicago Imagism and California funk.
But he is simply deft and dexterous, aping R. Crumb and Philip Guston without any of the gutsiness or exposed inner life of these artists.
