Regardless of who makes these monotonous knockoffs, the results are the same: variations on Richter, Warhol, Tuymans, Polke, Celmins, Fischl, Rauschenberg, Peyton, Doig, Close, Robert Longo, Lisa Ruyter, or any original photorealist.
Brock Enright’s kidnapping piece is incredibly annoying but intense; Cameron Jamie is better than this work indicates; ditto Bjarne Melgaard; Matt Greene’s Spanish-moss-like paintings are overly familiar and underdeveloped; and I’m still trying to figure out if Banks Violette is more than a latter-day Robert Longo.
There are LPs with art by “real” artists on the front, including pictures by Hermann Nitsch, Robert Longo, Josef Albers, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Raymond Pettibon, David Wojnarowicz, and a doozy of a Dalí that Jackie Gleason commissioned.
The show includes Salle and Schnabel and deletes Eric Fischl and Robert Longo; it expunges Sandro Chia, Jorg Immendorf, and Markus Lupertz, opting for big kahunas like Clemente and Anselm Kiefer, around whom it treads lightly, inserting only a book by each.
As it is, the exclusions feel tainted: Gary Hill and Bryan Hunt are in; Robert Longo and Kerry James Marshall are out.
The scene could be a modern-day martyrdom by the most theatrical painter of them all, Caravaggio; the prelude to David’s Oath of the Horatii; or one of Robert Longo’s large black-and-white Falling Men drawings of figures in dramatic arrested motion — human beings seemingly cut out from the world, thrust onto this pictorial stage.
Parrino clearly owes a debt to the so-called Pictures artists of the era, like Richard Prince, Troy Brauntuch, Jack Goldstein, Robert Longo, and even Barbara Kruger, who like Parrino developed a powerfully retinal, highly recognizable graphic style and exploited it.
The "Pictures" exhibition at Artist Space, curated by Douglas Crimp, with artists Troy Brauntuch, Jack Goldstein, Sherrie Levine, Robert Longo and Philip Smith, signaled a change in artistic atmosphere to a more theoretical, cerebral, critical approach.
