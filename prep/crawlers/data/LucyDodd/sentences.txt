His particular obsessions, though inspired, are less important than the size of the screen onto which he projected them (which is one reason you can see his legacy in such divergent contemporary offspring as Ryan Trecartin, Andra Ursuta, Elaine Cameron-Weir, Lucy Dodd, and Josh Kline).
I can think of other artists who have this maniacal eye for overlooked, discounted, outside-the-mainstream optical material (artists like Oliver Wasow, Brad Phillips, Lucy Dodd, Carl Ostendarp, or writer Rabih Alameddine come immediately to mind).
I’m thinking, for example, of the blasted-looking abstract paintings of Lucy Dodd; the scorching color and rash repeating orders of Katherine Bernhardt; the erratic organization and Eros of Keltie Ferris; the maybe-too-pretty but hobbled Modernism of Patricia Treib; the all-out discontentedness and retinal attack of Bjarne Melgaard; the insane glutted flat surfaces of Borna Sammak.
Bajagic harnessed dark forces in paintings and shadowy collages that bring together sex, violence, lone­liness, fantasy, and imag­ination, and in one show, she joined the artists Elaine Cameron-Weir, Andra Ursuta, Dawn Kasper, Lucy Dodd, and others in a strain of feminism that takes no prisoners and is thankfully and unapologetically upon us.
With this show, Bajagic is joining fellow female artists Cameron-Weir, Andra Ursuta, Dawn Kasper, Lucy Dodd, and others too numerous to mention; a beautiful strain of feminism that takes no prisoners is upon us.
Nor would more unpredictable excellent younger talents like Andra Ursuta, Josh Kline, or Lucy Dodd.
Think of the paintings of Lucy Dodd as very, very low-relief earthworks along the lines of Robert Smithson’s or Michael Heizer’s.
I found myself having weird thoughts, like, “Maybe Lucy Dodd is Walter White, and she’s serving me liquid blue meth”.
