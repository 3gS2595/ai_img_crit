This is Barney’s Moby Dick by way of Beckett: a story that takes place nowhere but that touches on everything.
As with Melville’s Moby Dick, Barney’s tetrology is digressive; mystical about locations and objects; rife with Rabelaisian humor and overabundance; filled with historical, biblical, and mythical allusions; and takes place in micro- and macro-scales simultaneously.
To cheesecake, beefcake, and calendar art; Maxfield Parrish, Norman Rockwell, and Vargas; nudist magazine photography, the kind of kitsch the Nazis revered; and, although his art is more unsettling, subversive, and concentrated, perhaps even to John Currin, who flirts with the conservative side of painting, and who once brilliantly described Moby Dick as “the biggest nude in the universe”.
It’s Cat in the Hat meets Moby Dick by way of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade.
