That’s not enough for this show at this time in this place, especially when many of the better artists here are women (e.g., Kristin Baker, Misaki Kawai, Wangechi Mutu, Michelle Segre, Swoon, Anne Collier, Chie Fueki, Aida Ruilova, Laurel Nakadate, Huma Bhabha, Kate Gilmore, and Karyn Olivier).
Huma Bhabha’s multi-faced bronze sculpture We Come in Peace, a creating-destroying god on the roof of the Met.
Hutchins, Huma Bhabha, Sterling Ruby, Shio Kusaka, Sarah Lucas, and others have made ceramics almost as ubiquitous in galleries as painting and sculpture.
The Egyptian levels of optical clarity, blocky shapes, and opaque color have helped form contemporary artists as varied as Gary Hume, Wangechi Mutu, Huma Bhabha, and Joe Bradley.

But here I instantly got that his figures don’t simply function as ancient guardians, updates on Classical sculpture and tomb figures in limbo; they predict the totemic figuration and premodern strategies now being taken up by artists like Huma Bhabha, Tom Thayer, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, and many others.

Werner Herzog’s film of Kuwaiti oil fields set afire is a glimpse into the abyss; Huma Bhabha’s giant head is dying god and emerging monster.
