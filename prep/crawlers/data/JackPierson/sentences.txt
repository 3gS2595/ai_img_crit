This biennial might have twinkled more had the curators switched a few of the big names for slightly less predictable big names: Mary Heilmann instead of Robert Mangold, Jim Nutt rather than David Hockney, William Eggleston instead of Jack Pierson, Lee Bontecou rather than Alex Hay, and R. Crumb and Cady Noland instead of Paul McCarthy and Richard Prince.
Peter Bellamy and Roland Hagenberg, for example, photographed dozens of 1980s artists; Nan Goldin, David Seidner, and Jack Pierson also dabbled in it.
Some people manage to look striking: Elaine de Kooning with her cigarette; Sherrie Levine, the only one in sunglasses; David Hammons in the manner of a street prophet; Agnes Martin as our Gertrude Stein; artist Mike Sale in a dog collar; and Jack Pierson shirtless.
Heâ€™s moving beyond one of the more ubiquitous aesthetics of the 1990s, one he helped establish: the anything-young-is-good school of photography, an outgrowth of the apotheosis-of-the-snapshot genre, as practiced most recently by Nan Goldin, Jack Pierson, and the late Mark Morrisroe.
However, the show, maybe the most memorable of its ilk, proved that New York criticism often gets things initially wrong, and included numerous artists who went on to have major careers, among them Matthew Barney, Janine Antoni, Sophie Calle, Andrea Fraser, Coco Fusco, Rene Green, Byron Kim, Zoe Leonard, Glen Ligon, Jack Pierson, Fred Wilson, Charles Ray, Sadie Benning and Lorna Simpson.
