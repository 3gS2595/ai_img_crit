Saccoccio’s paintings come dangerously close to looking like mid-century abstraction, particularly the work of artists like Joan Mitchell and de Kooning.
The show could have gotten really juicy by demonstrating that while de Kooning was influenced by Picasso, the ravenous Spaniard, ever on the prowl for fresh meat, pillaged him in the 1950s and produced some of the wildest work of his career.
“He broke the ice,” as de Kooning so generously put it.
She seems smitten with de Kooning, Diebenkorn, Gorky, Giacometti, Matta, and even Julian Schnabel.
We’ve all been transfixed by Picasso in his underpants at the beach, Bacon in his grimy studio, de Kooning studying his paintings, Leon Golub’s huge head, Hockney’s Dutch boy grin, Kahlo’s unibrow, Schnabel in his pajamas, Mapplethorpe’s image of Louise Bourgeois holding a giant phallus, and his self-portrait as a faun.
“Somehow,” de Kooning said dryly, “that didn’t seem so good”.
Not just because it is astoundingly beautiful or because Gorky was, with de Kooning, perhaps the most talented draftsman in the history of American art.
Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers, Richard Hamilton, and sundry Nouveaux Realistes had used similar images; de Kooning taped a Camel cigarette ad to a painting in 1949.
If the first names that come to you aren’t John Holmes and Linda Lovelace, they might be Courbet, de Kooning, or, most of all, Gerhard Richter.
There is, for example, no late-1940s black-and-white de Kooning and only one work each by Pollock, Kline, and Still.
Both are in the company of de Kooning, Kline, and the other giants of mid-century painting.
The values of Abstract Expressionism included enormous scale, the male painter alone in the arena painting in pursuit of total abstraction (except for de Kooning — who Pollock said “betrayed it”).
It was the show in which de Kooning reportedly told Warhol he was “a killer of art”.
Of his contemporaries, only the always generous de Kooning saw the real, deep content of Guston’s late art.
The result is that you see through mastery and market thoughts, and glimpse an artist whose energy is hot like de Kooning’s but whose work is endlessly ironic, posed, utilizing ideas that others and probably he dismissed as useless, silly, stupid.
It’s a collapsing of Lucian and Sigmund Freud by way of de Kooning, Franz West, early Oldenburg, and the pregnant figures of Alice Neel.
Not only is it the best headpiece I’ve seen outside Aztec art, it looks forward to Jasper Johns’s great crosshatch paintings, even to de Kooning’s last lucid looping lines.
) Of course, de Kooning was Dutch.
“What’s more modernist than de Kooning?
Conglomerations of Picasso, Cubism, clown portraits, cartoons, Surrealism, dashes of Basquiat’s megawatt graphic energy, and splashes of de Kooning (especially his abstract 1950 masterpiece, Excavation) provide wall power and give viewers a lot to look at and relish.
It was akin to what de Kooning reportedly said to Warhol: “You’re a killer of art, you’re a killer of beauty … you’re even a killer of laughter”.
Think of his paintings as places where Warhol’s disaster, flower, and Rorschach paintings meet Pollock’s and de Kooning’s, all done in black mucoid goo.
This show, organized by MoMA’s chief curator emeritus of painting and sculpture, John Elderfield, proves that de Kooning started great and only got better.
Beyond triggering castration anxieties or latent authority issues, this painting suggests how terrifying it must have been for de Kooning to use—and then give up—his considerable academic skills.
) Even in the early forties, you see de Kooning trying to take apart and flatten Cubism, keeping the figure but also integrating it into something closer to abstraction.
(Edwin Denby, the critic, claimed that the artist’s struggle with perspective actually made de Kooning sick to his stomach.
For proof of de Kooning’s whole-ball-of-wax approach, I recommend—after you’ve been staggered by the 1950 masterpiece Excavation, a tightly constructed cave-painting supernova of jigsaw space, mouths, and pent-up-ness—spending a day or so in the visual Gatling gun that is section four of the show.
Clement Greenberg called keeping the figure in his art a major mistake and claimed de Kooning was in decline.
Jackson Pollock, whom de Kooning always spoke of admiringly, railed, “Bill, you betrayed it.
That was in the mid-fifties, as de Kooning was being pretty nearly written off, assumed to be regressive by an art world that was pronouncing painting dead.
Now I see that de Kooning kept painting the women—just leaving the women out.
As de Kooning put it, “Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented”.
(Some of the paintings from this period are tainted by whispers: that de Kooning was being heavily aided by his assistants, that his developing dementia was robbing him of intellect.
)Everything on hand makes it impossible to think that by 1959 de Kooning was repeating himself, betraying causes, making cotton-candy abstractions, turning out second-rate sculpture, or running on painterly fumes.
When I think about Barnett Newman blathering on about “the sublime” …M.S.: When no one’s listening, you fall in love with your own voice.J.S.: When I came of age, de Kooning was always attacked as a sexist pig who slept with everybody and painted women to look like crazed gargoyles.
J.S.: Well, John Currin has painted Bea Arthur and Nadine Gordimer …M.S.: Calling de Kooning misogynist is simpleminded.
They loved de Kooning in the forties.
They all claimed that de Kooning was violating the rules of artistic progress.
He loved to play the part of the hanging judge, regretfully executing artists who fell afoul of serious taste.J.S.: For me, de Kooning proves that the idea of the ever-forward march of modernism is a crock—that all art is contemporary art.M.S.: Well, after 1950 de Kooning wasn’t interested in making a good painting, as that is conventionally understood.
One of the most pathos-filled moments in American art, to me, is when de Kooning says, “I know what you’re doing,” and adds, “I want to give you one that I’ll miss”.
He wasn’t happy about this, but he never tried to change with the times.J.S.: Not only was everyone claiming that de Kooning was dead, they said painting was dead too!
Robert Rauschenberg, by the way, never stopped admiring de Kooning.
But yes, that personal, romantic brushstroke seemed to encourage all kinds of narcissistic bombast from artists too eager to express themselves.J.S.: As for the eighties, de Kooning may have been suffering from dementia, but I’d claim the very last thing to go in him is what was deepest: his incomparable sense of structure, composition, space, and surface.
J.S.: Well, if you have an extra wrinkle in your brain, like de Kooning probably did, you may still be your painter-self.M.S.: I think this issue is overblown.

(It’s touching and telling that de Kooning gave the drawing to Rauschenberg, knowing what the young artist intended.
In her Easter Island–meets–Disney–de Kooning–and–Warhol portraits of Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, and others, Pensato combines the gesturalism of action painting, the painterliness of Abstract Expressionism, the blatancy of Pop, and the wild style of graffiti.
The insightful painter Cheryl Donegan updates Johns’s quote, admiringly calling artists like those in “Unmonumental” “the fucked-up sons and daughters of de Kooning and Warhol”.
