Subsequently, his coterie of chosen ones was expanded by Charles Wright, Dia’s next director, then Michael Govan, its current one.
He assumed DIA’s directorship in 2008 with a mandate to correct the tragedy wrought by its former director Michael Govan, who in 2004 needlessly and permanently shuttered and gutted its legendary West 22nd Street building.
LaCMA director Michael Govan was Thomas Krens’s right hand man, for God’s sake.
(This, by the way, makes the fourth such coup, after Anne Philbin leaving the Drawing Center to become Director of the Hammer, Michael Govan departing Dia to work as Director of LACMA, and Jeffrey Deitch being named Director of LA MoCA.
The glitzy 280-page catalogue — which quotes Steven Spielberg testifying that Crichton was “an out-scaled” talent as a collector, and LACMA director Michael Govan saying he “had an incredible eye” — estimates the painting will fetch between 10 and 15 million dollars.
Michael Govan, then Dia Director and now in charge of the Los Angeles Museum of Art, was the man who made the decision.
In May 2003, Michael Govan, the former director of the Dia Center for the Arts (and a Krens protégé), opened an enormous facility in Beacon, New York, to exhibit Dia’s permanent collection.
It can be boiled down to the yearning of the board of trustees—led at the time by Leonard Riggio, director Michael Govan, and curator Lynne Cooke—to open a huge space outside New York to exhibit Dia’s magnificent permanent collection.

Having opened a 292,000-square-foot space in upstate Beacon, N.Y., the year before, Dia, under director Michael Govan, who was mentored by Gugg director Thomas Krens and is now the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Art, unforgivably closes down Dias West 22nd Street building.
