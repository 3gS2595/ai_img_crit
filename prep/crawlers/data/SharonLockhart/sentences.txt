Unfortunately there’s also a lot of unprocessed references to and borrowings from Bill Viola, Matthew Barney, Sharon Lockhart, Stanley Kubrick, New Wave Cinema, Shirin Neshat, Star Trek, and The Twilight Zone.
After looking hard at Sharon Lockhart’s work for more than 10 years and failing to get what numerous high mucky-muck curators, big-deal museum people, powerful gallerists, and major critics and theoreticians—some of whom have called this artist “insightful,” “ingenious,” and “inspired”—admire, I have decided that often there’s nothing in Lockhart’s work to get.
The other is the team’s weakness for artists who are only moderately talented but immensely, if inexplicably, popular in curatorial circles (e.g., Craigie Horsfield, Sharon Lockhart, Mary Kelly, Lee Mingwei, Liz Craft, Katie Grinnan, and Dario Robleto—none of whom, it must be said, bomb here).
In this impressive but uneven exhibition (ickily mistitled “Secret World of Girls”), three of the pictures recall the work of Sharon Lockhart, and show Kurland in a kind of after-school special mode.
