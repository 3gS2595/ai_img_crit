While watching Sarah Morris’s lushly mesmerizing, oddly odious, intermittently boring 26-minute film Los Angeles—as I gazed at close-ups of producer Robert Evans being shaved by a topless blonde, director Brett Ratner dressing in the back of a limo, John Travolta alongside Sandra Bullock, Jack at a Lakers game, Brad on the set, and Uma and Oprah on the red carpet—it dawned on me that we’re entering a new era.
Think Gary Hume, Inka Essenhigh, or Sarah Morris without the enamel; Jeremy Blake video stills on canvas; the cleanness of Takashi Murakami; the slabs of Arturo Herrera; fussier Monique Prieto; or Ghost World.
The other, Sarah Morris, is in love with the city’s spectacle.
Stella is the artist who launched 10,000 careers; artists as varied as Peter Halley, Sarah Morris, Ugo Rondinone, Matthew Ritchie, and Thomas Scheibitz, who have used Stella’s structures, compositional strategies, and specific colors, to Isa Genzken, Mark Grotjahn, Jessica Stockholder, Katharina Grosse, Steven Parrino, and countless others who’ve followed Stella into the expanded fields of painting.

A rendition of a red Kabbalah bracelet skewers boomers’ searching for their inner mystics, and a graffitilike painting, titled Sarah Morris (Brice Marden) or Bill Clinton, has the caption “dude it’s about your mama”.
These paintings predict work by artists like Gary Hume, Sarah Morris, and Odili Donald Odita.
Nearby, a brightly colored, hard-edged Sarah Morris of a modernist building façade shows how artists are circling back to sixties geometric abstraction in order to reconnect it to the world.
