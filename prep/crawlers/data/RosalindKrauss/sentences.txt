Rosalind Krauss has written about “images that do not decorate but rather structure the basic mechanisms of thought”.
When Lynda Benglis attacked the macho image of the artist by posing naked with a dildo in Artforum (November 1974), Annette Michelson and Rosalind Krauss (who called the picture “vulgar,” “disgusting,” and “the last straw”) resigned from the magazine.
On a more nitpicky level, Rosalind Krauss lamented that there used to be good writing in artists’ catalogs, but now there’s not.
Similarly, Rosalind Krauss’s praise of the early work was invariably followed by a dismissal of the late.
Rather than an array of critics, the chronology toes a very narrow line, listing texts by theoretical gurus Craig Owens, Rosalind Krauss, Jean François Lyotard, Julia Kristeva, and Jean Baudrillard.
Rosalind Krauss called him “repulsive”; Yve-Alain Bois went with “crude”; Benjamin Buchloh wrote that Koons is among the “neurasthenic victims of opportunistic assimilation” (whatever that means).
The ever-cantankerous Hilton Kramer chastised the exhibition’s organizer for making Johns “look like a bore” and catalogue author Michael Crichton for “making him sound like an ass,” but ArtForum’s Rosalind Krauss dissented, describing an experience akin to “watching a poetic world notching piece by piece into place, seeing a universe of feeling slowly exfoliate from a restricted supply of imagery”.
Carter Radcliff notes, "The following month, the other associate editors -- Lawrence Alloway, Max Kozloff, Rosalind Krauss, Joseph Masheck, Annette Michelson -- published a letter to the editor-in-chief, John Coplans, to let the art world know how deeply they had been offended by the extreme vulgarity of Bengliss picture".
