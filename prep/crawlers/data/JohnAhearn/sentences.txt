Of the many artists who came to stay, two stand out: Camilo Jose Vergara as a revelation, and John Ahearn as a warning.
John Ahearn moved to the Bronx in the early ’80s.
“In a way what happened in say the late ‘80s or beginning of the ‘90s was that finally the art world’s scales fell from their eyes and they realized that, wait a second, all this is real and we don’t know anything about it,” says the sculptor John Ahearn.

The year after Tilted Arc’s removal was ordered, Bronx-based sculptor John Ahearn was selected to install three painted bronze sculptures in front of a Bronx police station.
