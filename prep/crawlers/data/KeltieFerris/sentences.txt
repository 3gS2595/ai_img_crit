Keltie FerrisAt Mitchell-Innes & Nash534 West 26th Street / Through May 19I’ve been a fan of Keltie Ferris’s hot Day-Glo spray-painted, structured, multi-matrixed large paintings since she emerged fresh out of Yale’s MFA program in the mid-aughts.
Showing some of the more wild-looking paintings and sculptures out there right now are Dona Nelson, Pensato, Lisa Alvarado, Patricia Treib, Juliana Huxtable, Jess Fuller, Johanna Jackson, Sahar Khoury, Lee Relvas, Mira Dancy, Keltie Ferris, Rachel Harrison, Alice Mackler, Aki Sasamoto, Rochelle Goldberg, Stacy Leigh, and the joker herself, Bernhardt.
Keltie Ferris: “Paintings and Body Prints” Mitchell-Innes & Nash Through Oct.
17About eight years ago Keltie Ferris burst onto the New York painting scene like a bat out of hell, that is, if you define hell as the Yale M.F.A. painting program; back then, her large Day-Glo-colored canvases were perfect crosses between hazy 1970s Color Field painting, pixilated digital space breaking up and reforming in odd-shaped plates, and painterly abstraction at the same time totally avoiding any derivative overlap with artists like Kelly Walker or Gerhard Richter.
As seen at Eleven Rivington, Dryer’s constructed shapes, pieced-together diptychs, and propped panels are antecedents to much of the better literalized, concrete, physical abstract painting being made well now by artists like Hayley Tompkins, Lisa Beck, Wendy White, Keltie Ferris, Katherine Bernhardt, Ulrike Muller, and Sarah Crowner.
Her art connects to other organizers of form and chaos, Jessica Jackson-Hutchins, Uri Aran, Catherine Ahearn, Andra Ursuta, Wendy White, Keltie Ferris, Sarah Braman, Anna Betbeze, Jeff Williams, and others.
