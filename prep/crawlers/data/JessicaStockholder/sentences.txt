The best of Rachel Harrison’s smartly snarky, heavily attitudinal, sometimes traditional-looking new free-standing sculptural amalgamations—some of which sport stuffed chickens and diet drinks—look as if Robert Rauschenberg, Jean Dubuffet, Louise Nevelson, and John Chamberlain made sculptures together and had Renoir and Hans Hoffmann paint them while Jessica Stockholder, Isa Genzken, and Franz West kibitzed.
In addition to a sprinkling of sculpture influenced, however indirectly, by Jessica Stockholder or Rachel Harrison, there’s a lot of what I call “little art”: drawings or collages or sculptural arrangements done with lots of wee bits, things, marks, or parts.
Artists who have foundered in this decorative sea include Judy Pfaff, Jessica Stockholder, and Frank Stella himself.
Thus all the formal echoes of Rauschenberg and the dematerializing of the art object of post-minimalist sculpture; Jessica Stockholder and Cady Noland’s notions of object-based installation; and numerous references to Pictures artists like Gretchen Bender, Sherrie Levine, and Cindy Sherman.
Stella is the artist who launched 10,000 careers; artists as varied as Peter Halley, Sarah Morris, Ugo Rondinone, Matthew Ritchie, and Thomas Scheibitz, who have used Stella’s structures, compositional strategies, and specific colors, to Isa Genzken, Mark Grotjahn, Jessica Stockholder, Katharina Grosse, Steven Parrino, and countless others who’ve followed Stella into the expanded fields of painting.
Without Pfaff, there’s no Sze, Phoebe Washburn, Jessica Stockholder, or ten other first-tier artists.
Dia made maximum use of these magical spaces, presenting stellar long-term exhibitions of artists like Gerhard Richter, Bridget Riley, Brice Marden, Jessica Stockholder, and many others.
