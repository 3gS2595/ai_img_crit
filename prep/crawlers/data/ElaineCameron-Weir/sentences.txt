Read full review May to September were electric building-filling months at the New Museum, with four standout concurrent solo shows by women artists: the late under-known Italian visionary Carol Rama, the gnarly art of Kaari Upson, the materially complex alchemical sculptures of Elaine Cameron-Weir, and the steamy, seductive portraits of a beautiful community of black dancers and others by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye.
In one building, you have the late, Italian visionary Carol Rama, whose drawings bring us into the optical inner sanctums of sexuality, self-doubt, and female power; the wild-style, Mike Kelly–like dandy and dynamism of Kaari Upson (who in one video fake-shops for a Las Vegas tract house and inspects the home by crawling on the kitchen counter and rubbing her hair on the stucco ceiling); Elaine Cameron-Weir’s utterly alchemical, materially masterful installation; and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, plying her still-developing portrait skills in the spirit of Neel herself.
His particular obsessions, though inspired, are less important than the size of the screen onto which he projected them (which is one reason you can see his legacy in such divergent contemporary offspring as Ryan Trecartin, Andra Ursuta, Elaine Cameron-Weir, Lucy Dodd, and Josh Kline).
Bajagic harnessed dark forces in paintings and shadowy collages that bring together sex, violence, lone­liness, fantasy, and imag­ination, and in one show, she joined the artists Elaine Cameron-Weir, Andra Ursuta, Dawn Kasper, Lucy Dodd, and others in a strain of feminism that takes no prisoners and is thankfully and unapologetically upon us.
And with the help of other artists: There’s Elaine Cameron-Weir’s futuristic cave art, consisting of a giant clamshell that acts as a incense burner (I love this thing), Dora Budor’s overhead slab filled with fake frogs reminiscent of those that fell like a plague in the film Magnolia, and Daniel Keller’s tower sculpture made of a solar panel, fake rocks, and the kind of foodstuffs used by survivalists.
