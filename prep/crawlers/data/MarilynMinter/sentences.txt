Whatever it will be, it’s scheduled to open in February with an exhibition organized by the artist Marilyn Minter called “The Virgin Show”.
As Minter wrote to me, “all the artists have never shown before ( they probably are still virgins too) and it is curated by Marilyn Minter who just happens to be a virgin”.
After decades of neglect, Marilyn Minter, now 59, not only ended up in the last Whitney Biennial; her work was featured on the cover of that show’s catalogue, and her paintings now sell for more than $130,000.
Good paintings are present, notably by Mark Grotjahn, Mark Bradford, Rudolf Stingel and Marilyn Minter.
