With a hungry, documenting eye as lucid as Walker Evans’s and Robert Frank’s, photographer LaToya Ruby Frazier photographs working-class American cities and people decimated by toxic environments and jerry-rigged governmental policy.
LaToya Ruby Frazier’s straight documentary photography has reignited this sleeping form and made it into a raging beast; Louis Fratino’s personal, painterly depictions of everyday gay life raise the bar of figurative-visionary painting, as do the stitched, painted, and sewn works of Tschabalala Self; ditto Katherine Bernhardt.
In the searingly honest, empathetic documentary images of self-described “artist, curator, educator, and photographer” LaToya Ruby Frazier, I see the rotten social malignancy that perpetuates entrenched racial discrimination that is deeply inscribed into law, lending, and health-care policies.
Yesterday I woke up, read the list, and, when I saw the name of 50-year-old New York artist Nicole Eisenman (in addition to the excellent LaToya Ruby Frazier), I was over the moon.
Under Lehman, the museum proved that it could be experimental and political while also doing worthy shows; in the last three seasons, the museum has presented solos of Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kehinde Wiley, Swoon, Wangechi Mutu, LaToya Ruby Frazier, and Mickalene Thomas.
It’s silly to use one kind of work to shake a stick at another — and I love beautiful contemporary pictures of carefree youth and riveting pictures of the life of global commerce — yet this show made me long to see more artists like Cole (photographers like Zoe Strauss and LaToya Ruby Frazier who today give us images of worlds gone wrong) getting close to situations that need to be gotten close to and pictured in ways that with no text whatsoever bring tears to one’s eyes without a hint of spectacle.
