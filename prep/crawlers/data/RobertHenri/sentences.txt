For example, when looking at works by Robert Henri, William Glackens, John Sloan, and other artists of the group known as The Eight—founder Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney’s first aesthetic love, which takes up much too much space here—you will probably think mostly of Manet.
Ashcan painters like Bellows and Robert Henri did this by painting the underclass of American life: wrestlers, workers, working girls, protesters.
Her painting echoes realists like John Singer Sargent (albeit without the brushy fireworks and flare for fashion) and the early 20th-century American artists known as the Eight, especially George Bellows and Robert Henri, who painted unorthodox subjects in conservative styles.
Included will be the strange realism of Angela Dufresne, who combines the daubing brushwork of Robert Henri and the cellophane transparencies and feathery touch of Florine Stettheimer.
In the U.S., realists like ­William Glackens, Robert Henri, and George Bellows were called “modern,” but only because of their subject matter—­vernacular street scenes, prostitutes, boxers—and Manet-like greasy paint and post-Impressionist brushwork.
