Consider what the 34-year-old Walker Evans did two days before the opening of his 1938 MOMA survey—the first exhibition in that venue ever devoted to a photographer.
Some of the black-and-whites, collectively titled “Morning Call” (at the Salon 94 space), were made in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in an area photographed by Walker Evans.
Judd, for all his seriousness, is less grand and more quotidian — nearer to the stripped-down wholeness, visual lucidity, and existential absorption conjured by photographer Walker Evans.
With a hungry, documenting eye as lucid as Walker Evans’s and Robert Frank’s, photographer LaToya Ruby Frazier photographs working-class American cities and people decimated by toxic environments and jerry-rigged governmental policy.
She’s also started painting women, as seen in the exceptional multi-portrait of the window of a hair salon with numerous depictions of models and styles, a painterly update on Walker Evans’s great picture of a photo-studio photographer’s window with hundreds of little pictures; Casteel seems prepared to take a rightful place on the front lines of contemporary painting.
Her pictures can stand alongside of and sometimes recall those of Cartier-Bresson, Lisette Model, Robert Frank, André Kertesz, Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Walker Evans, Gary Winogrand, Richard Avedon, and Weegee.
