Elizabeth Taylor died today, and part of something American is gone but not gone.
Perhaps because of who I am, when I was born, or my dopeyness about movie stars, for me Elizabeth Taylor is mainly a beauty with black hair and gaudy eye makeup in Cleopatra, a friend of Michael Jackson’s, and a tremendous AIDS activist.
Most of all, for me, however, Elizabeth Taylor is Andy Warhol’s paintings of her.
