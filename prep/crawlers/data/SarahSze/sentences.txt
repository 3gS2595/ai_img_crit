Among the standouts, there’s the inflating-deflating starfish ceiling sculpture (a bit too reminiscent of Sarah Sze) by the nevertheless very talented Shih Chieh Huang; “Photosynthesis Robot,” two houseplants riding atop a cart, by the collective known as Futurefarmers, who say the piece is a “possible perpetual motion machine driven by phototropism”.
An early Lisa Yuskavage one reads, “Chicks with jugs/Manned engines of ambivalence”; a Sarah Sze invite mentions “soaring/less improvisational”; a Jules de Balincourt note simply says, “still in school”.
Sarah Sze, 36, and Phoebe Washburn, 32, “nurture” their materials more.

Unlike Sarah Sze, who is a space-destroying, anal-retentive, warrior-princess artist (owing to the amazing exactitude, ironic reuse of materials, and the spatial voraciousness in her work); Ann Hamilton, who’s only a producer of photogenic New Agey sets; or Rachel Whiteread, who is a mummy maker by way of Nauman, a mortician, and a magician, Washburn is a pack rat, magpie, bag lady, mollusk artist.
