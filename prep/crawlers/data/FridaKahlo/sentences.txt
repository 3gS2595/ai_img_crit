Cézanne, Matisse, Picasso and the cubists, Mondrian, Frida Kahlo, Florine Stettheimer, and all the rest finished the job, broke space up, and flattened it out again.

Artist, poet, wife of Max Ernst from 1946 until he died in 1976, and (along with Frida Kahlo, Leonora Carrington, Kay Sage, Lee Miller, Maya Deren, Remedios Varo, and Leonor Fini) one of a group of great women Surrealists, she was at the center of a movement that was a vicious mill for women.
