I’d split “Best in Show” among Christian Holstad, Brian Belott, and Devendra Banhart (who really shines in a lovely three-person show at Canada).
While I love Brian Belott’s work, and Janiva Ellis and Pat Phillips are okay, the rest is generic.
There are whole walls of Ellen Berkenblit, Sadie Laska, Lauren Luloff, Tal R, Brian Belott, Tom Anholt, and Chris Martin and sculpture by Nari Ward, Thomas Houseago, and Matthew Monahan.
