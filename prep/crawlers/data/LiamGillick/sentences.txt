This useful term, coined in the mid 1990s by the French art critic Nicolas Bourriaud, was meant to describe the then groundbreaking practices of artists like Rirkrit Tiravanija, Philippe Parreno, Pierre Huyghe, Liam Gillick, Vanessa Beecroft, and others whose work often involved what Bourriaud called “connectivity” and “interactivity”.
In fact, Casey Kaplan represents several of these artists, including Ceal Foyer, Carsten Höller (whose work is close in spirit to Donnelly’s), and Liam Gillick, whose shows are weak but who often shines outside galleries.
Liam Gillick can make it not make any sense but eloquently and with style.
Tiravanija’s comfy video lounge, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster’s sonic rain forest, Douglas Gordon’s wall texts, Liam Gillick’s S-shaped benches, Philippe Parreno’s lighted marquee, and Angela Bulloch’s LED night sky are all okay.
