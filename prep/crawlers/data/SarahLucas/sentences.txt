“Portraits of Artists,” at Luhring Augustine, is a warm if academic walk down artistic memory lane in which one can bask in portraits of ancestor figures like Dalí and Duchamp, then scrutinize recent arrivals on the shores of renown like Janine Antoni balancing on a police barricade or Sarah Lucas being sprayed by a can of beer.
Other standouts in the drunk section include Edgar Bryan’s bleary but delicate painting, Rirkrit Tiravanija’s detritus-in-a-box from one of his feasts, Sarah Lucas’s crinkled bronze Beer Can Penis, Donald Morgan and Scott Reeder’s geometric Drunk Robot, and a nicely disheveled painting by Charline von Heyl.
From private parts on figures in the work of Tracey Emin, Su-en Wong, Sarah Lucas, and Marlene McCarty to those in the photographs and self-portraits of Patti Chang, Malerie Marder, Katy Grannan, Kembra Pfahler, and Vanessa Beecroft, hairless pudenda are popping up in art galleries all over town.
All of which makes you understand why Cahun—in a proto-Sarah Lucas move—posed in a white jersey that read, “Don’t Kiss Me”.
Without her, artists as disparate as Sue Williams, Lorna Simpson, and Sarah Lucas mightn’t have happened.
Realism in all its guises fuels the beast that is the best and the worst of British art: the Madame Tussaud realism of the Chapmans; the unnatural/natural science of grandmaster Hirst; the physicalized imprints of Whiteread; the ball-busting, Dada recapitulations of Sarah Lucas (who here continues her grad-schoolish, parafeminist effrontery); the insane sculptural accuracy of Ron Mueck, less an artist than a surreal F/X guy; the photo-documentary sociology of Richard Billingham, whose 32 images of his disfunctioning family are some of the most jarring, most tender, works on view; the flesh-and-bloodiness of Marc Quinn; or Ofili’s excremental vision.
Hutchins, Huma Bhabha, Sterling Ruby, Shio Kusaka, Sarah Lucas, and others have made ceramics almost as ubiquitous in galleries as painting and sculpture.
Leave it to British badass Sarah Lucas to provide tip-top hard-core moments—bronze casts fashioned from tights and panty hose and made into gloriously.
Leave it to British badass Sarah Lucas to provide tip-top hard-core moments—bronze casts fashioned from tights and panty hose and made into gloriously distorted golden figures, some sporting massive erections.
I’d genuinely love to see Chris Ofili or Sarah Lucas get a crack at Kate.
Jake and Dinos Chapman place tortured figures in glass cases; Jenny Saville’s contorted Gargantuas are direct descendants of Bacon’s golems; Tracey Emin works with blood and guts; Sarah Lucas gives us spooks and deformities.
Nearby, Sarah Lucas simultaneously celebrates and bitch-slaps art history—and also the adage that gender is destiny—in her neo-Dada Fuck Destiny, a found-object sculpture that apes a fluorescent phallus penetrating a vulva of leather couch cushions.
