The painter Deborah Kass—who has, usually in Warhol’s style—thinks Streisand was “too much like Andy: too outside, immigrant, other, and too Jewish”.
There in the little park between and in the shadows of the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges, Deborah Kass’s large, Lik-M-Aid–yellow sculpture OY/YO lands right in that magnificent sweet spot — endlessly majestic, riddled with Whitman, Hart Crane, and the American Dream.
And yet, as an art critic, I have to admit, from Rashid Johnson’s vexing yellow sculpture that looks like a prison and a butter factory to Adrián Villar Rojas’s cast cement modern Mayan “ruins” on the High Line to Kara Walker’s magnificent sphinx from last summer to that sweet Deborah Kass sculpture (both commissioned by the Brooklyn megadeveloper Two Trees), this semi-privatization of public space has produced some of the best public art the city has seen in decades — in fact, it may even have cracked the seemingly impossible task of staging good public art.
Honorable mentions: I could easily go on about the Chelsea shows of Lily van der Stokker, Casey Cook, Deborah Kass, and the ever-young 70-year-old Joan Snyder at Betty Cuningham, who’s doing what she’s done for decades, only better than ever.
