I saw it in Muhammad Ali just after he knocked out George Foreman, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, the skipping dance of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and the way Warhol put his fingers to his pouty mouth.
Two of its most ravishing moments remind us that the movies are the dominant art form of the 20th century, American or otherwise: Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers’s meltingly beautiful skipping dance to Cole Porter’s “Night and Day” in The Gay Divorcee, and Busby Berkeley’s ecstatically lunatic choreography in Gold Diggers of 1933, featuring dancing girls who form ornate, pulsating patterns while playing neon violins.
Or an Indian raga or the little tripping dance of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers to “Cheek to Cheek” in Top Hat.
The museum should play continuous loops of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers dancing cheek-to-cheek in Top Hat; a mad choreographed sequence from Busby Berkeley; Steamboat Willie; and Martha Graham being a banshee.
As Fred Astaire sang, “It’s romancing out loud”.
