Arranged in a curving, walk-through, triangular sort of configuration, Switch is a combination of Serra’s previous curved-steel pieces (the best among them being Intersection II; the worst, Tilted Arc) and the Torqued Ellipses (not my fave).
Then came the debacle of his public-art project, Tilted Arc, about which enough has been said.
After years of delays, in the middle of the night on March 15, 1989, Tilted Arc was dismantled and carted away to a warehouse in Maryland, where it still rests.
The year after Tilted Arc’s removal was ordered, Bronx-based sculptor John Ahearn was selected to install three painted bronze sculptures in front of a Bronx police station.
It was the antithesis of Richard Serra’s Tilted Arc tonnage, which haughtily, icily demanded your respect.
After a nine-year-long court case, testimony by scores of art-world witnesses, repeated claims by the artist that he would forever leave the United States if his work were altered in any way, Richard Serras Tilted Arc was removed from Federal Plaza.
