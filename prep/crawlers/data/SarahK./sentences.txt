Sarah K., meanwhile, has made cutout Indian headdresses and feathers.
Lola and Sarah K. clear $312.
I think Sarah K. will be a good artist if and when she stops trying to think her way through problems.
Sarah K. really rises to the occasion, keeps it simple, and flays two leather car seats, splaying them on canvas to look like saber-tooth-tiger carcasses.
Lola snips at Kymia, who grouses about Lola to Sarah K., who says “Lola is one of those people I stay away from” as Lola and Michelle side against Kymia who starts crying as Sara J. complains about Michelle and Lola who call Sara J. “a worrywart”.
Sarah K. happily confirms this.
The minute he’s paired with Sarah K. he crows, “Cutie with a booty … It’s pretty obvious she wants my body”.
After Sara J coyly observes that Sucklord “could impregnate Sarah K. by the end of this challenge,” Lola coos, “I’m not jealous … There’s enough of the Sucklord to go around”.
Worrying about what will be allowed by the judges, exhibiting total lack of confidence, he puts Sarah K. in charge.
Also in the bottom three is Sarah K., who’s never had a crit before.
