As with many of Khedoori’s places, this “city” exudes a Hopperesque solitude, and a haunted, Raymond Chandler sense of mystery.
And such is one of the ways to introduce Jeffrey “the Dude” Lebowski, the Coen brothers’ supremely chill, White Russian–swilling, Creedence-loving, malapropism-spouting, bowling-enthusiast stoner-hero who finds himself in the midst of a Raymond Chandler–esque caper.
When he adapted Raymond Chandler’s 1953 novel, Robert Altman intended his Philip Marlowe to be a man out of time — the reluctantly honorable P.I. was meant to be no match for the New Age selfishness of ‘70s L.A. And he isn’t!
Raymond Chandler invented early-20th-century L.A.; Francis Ford Coppola forged our vision of the Vietnam War; Andy Warhol combined clashing colors that were never together before and that palette is now ubiquitous; God creating Adam looks the way Michelangelo painted it; Oscar Wilde said “the mysterious loveliness” of fog didn’t exist before poets and painters.
Judging from the signs Grotjahn is attracted to, I deduce someone scared, strange, on the margins, avoiding big, glitzy stores, invoking a hardscrabble, old-school Raymond Chandler vibe, an almost alcoholic loner.
