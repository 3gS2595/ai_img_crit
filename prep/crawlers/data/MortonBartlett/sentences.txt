About how extraordinary it would have been to see genius outsiders like Henry Darger, James Castle, and Morton Bartlett.
It’s not known if Morton Bartlett ever read Nabokov’s classic, but in his own way he may have lived it.
When the great “outsiders” James Castle and Morton Bartlett came to light only about ten years ago, their works were sadly dispersed to the four winds, so let’s hope that a few smart local museums purchase large caches of this work so that it might be relished in public for years to come.
Compositionally and psychologically, they are Cindy Sherman unveiling her many selves, by way of Malick Sidibé, the Malian photographer who recorded the people around him posed against makeshift portable backdrops, and Morton Bartlett, who between 1936 and 1963 made anatomically correct dolls of pubescent girls, sewed wardrobes, and photographed them in either Shirley Temple poses or ballerinas.
But Gioni’s politics come through in the way he redefines who is called an artist, including scores of so-called outsiders like Morton Bartlett, whose anatomically correct sculptures of prepubescent girls with sculpted vulvas and hand-sewn clothes were discovered only after he died.
