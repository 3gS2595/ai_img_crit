Diane Arbus, Maya Deren, Henry Darger, Peter Saul, H.C. Westermann, Rube Goldberg, Ivan Albright, Ed Paschke, William Copley, Louis Eilshemius, or Jim Nutt—none of whom are included—would have shown the schizophrenia and pleasure in this separateness.
Good or bad, questionable or not, Louise Nevelson would be brought back into the mix, as would Marisol, Arman, Alice Neel, Paula Rego, Elaine de Kooning, and H.C. Westermann.
When looking at Nutt’s small-scale, wispy drawings and opalescent paintings, imagine Ingres and Mirò getting together with Arshile Gorky and Saul Steinberg to render a race of extraterrestrial Kabuki actors or intergalactic film noir actresses; or Cranach, Klee, H.C. Westermann, and R. Crumb drawing the refined gentlewomen of Flatland.
Meanwhile, weird artists like Dorothea Tanning, H.C. Westermann, and Paul Thek look great.
To this day, most permanent collections exclude geniuses like Bill Traylor, Adolf Wölfli, Martin Ramírez, Henry Darger, to say nothing of Gee’s Bend quilts, Hilma Af Klint, Emma Kunz, Marsden Hartley, Louis Eilshemius, George Ohr, James Castle, Forrest Bess, Jess, Jay DeFeo, Ray Johnson, Jim Nutt, Asger Jorn, Beauford Delaney, Bob Thompson, Robert Colescott, Oyvind Fahlstrom, Konrad Klapheck, Paula Rego, and H.C. Westermann.
