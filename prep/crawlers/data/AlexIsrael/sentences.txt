In their collection are artists like Prince, Joe Bradley, Christopher Wool, Nate Lowman, Alex Da Corte, Alex Israel, Dan Colen, and many other very famous artists.
The first thought I had about Alex Israel’s show at the brightly lit Beverly Hills Gagosian was, “This should be a career-ender”.
Plus, the additions of Anne Collier and Bernadette Corporation after that, and real-unreal-looking photos by Annette Kelm, and Laura Owens’s impressive flunky paintings, Alex Israel’s self-portrait painting-as-logo, and a number of Klara Liden pieces, including a handmade bench that rests on bundled cardboard boxes and doubles as a slide-projecting sculpture — all of these might lure viewers in for years to come.
Along with artists like Alex Israel, Frances Stark, Oliver Wasow, Ajay Kurian, Darja Bajagić, Margaret Lee, Ann Veronica, and many others, Prince is exploring the new unreal-real spaces we all live in.
