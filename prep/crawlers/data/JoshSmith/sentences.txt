This may be why Josh Smith’s current handsome show of paintings that look pretty much like Cy Twombly’s work can sell out, be included in museum surveys, and be fawned over by collectors: His work says to these people, “These paintings look just like Twombly, but they’re good because I know this, and the paintings also exist as ideas of paintings, and you are in on it”.
*This post has been corrected to show that Josh Smith’s paintings are priced up to $67,000, not $80,000.
(Josh Smith does, too, although this may have to do with all of his work being jammed together on one wall and generating this massive graphic impact.

Josh Smith’s densely hung painting show, which was at Luhring Augustine until last week, comes at you with an intense optical force that accurately replicates the psychic energy of our topsy-turvy world.
