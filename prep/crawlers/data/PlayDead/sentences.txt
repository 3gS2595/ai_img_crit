The resulting installation, Play Dead; Real Time, is hypnotic, multi-leveled, and much more moving than it has any right to be.
But Gordon’s elegant neutrality and flawless editing make Play Dead pointed without being preachy, soothing and contemplative but not scolding or contemptuous.
As simple and spare as Play Dead is, it’s also riveting.
This gives Play Dead a rhythm and an unconscious storyline.
The tape is silent, but muffled sounds wafting in from outdoors give Play Dead a wonderful, ethereal live soundtrack (perhaps it’s psychosomatic, but a couple of people I know swear they can also smell the elephant).
