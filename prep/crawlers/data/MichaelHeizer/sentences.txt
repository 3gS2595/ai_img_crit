Caught between an older, more radical generation of earthworkers like Michael Heizer, Walter De Maria, and Robert Smithson (who even in the late 1960s scorned the “ecology thing” and bewailed earth art’s lurking “religious, ethical undertones”) and younger, more rigorous outdoorsmen like Mark Dion and Olafur Eliasson, Goldsworthy seemed less a sculptor than a kind of landscape artist.
Michael Heizer gouged two rectangles out of the sides of a mesa in Nevada.
Even before reading Büchel’s proposal, I could see that these eight looming prototypes looked exactly like minimalistic works of sculpture and environmental interventions made by artists like Richard Serra, Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, Maya Lin, Walter De Maria, Nancy Holt, Donald Judd, James Turrell, Michael Heizer, Tony Smith, and many others.
In 2012, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art paid $70,000 for a 21-foot-tall, 340-ton boulder by artist Michael Heizer and installed it over a cement trench in front of the museum, paying $10 million for what is essentially a photo op.
Think of the paintings of Lucy Dodd as very, very low-relief earthworks along the lines of Robert Smithson’s or Michael Heizer’s.
Fischer’s extraordinary gesture touches on the tradition of indoor earthworks that includes pieces from the sixties and seventies by Gordon Matta-Clark, Robert Smithson, Walter De Maria, Michael Heizer, Chris Burden, and others, while also bringing together many of his ongoing themes of transparency, transformation, disruption, and destruction.
