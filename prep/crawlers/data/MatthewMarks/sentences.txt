At Matthew Marks, she gives us a room full of slick photographs of herself clad in T-shirt and panties, suspended like a side of beef in the middle of an empty loft space.
Not only did this season begin with a convergence of the disharmonic kind, in a series of exhibitions that climaxed in back-to-back black holes on 24th Street (Gary Hill at Barbara Gladstone, Sam Taylor-Wood at Matthew Marks, and Julia Scher at Andrea Rosen), but for two years people have been grousing that the art world was running out of steam, and were waiting for the ax to fall.
By the time you get through her current exhibition of 107 color photographs at Matthew Marks, you’ll know she’s still going through hell, that she spent 57 days last summer in some posh hospital, still knows a lot of people of ambiguous gender and sexuality, travels often, owns a house in the Hamptons, and hangs out with skinny bohemians half her age who let her into their bedrooms as they cavort naked with their children.

At Matthew Marks, Robert Gober has brought together five artists of wildly divergent styles and generations—playing them off each other brilliantly, on levels both formal and symbolic—to make what is, in essence, a Gober by other means.

After I’d dismissed Nan Goldin’s Matthew Marks show as clichéd, the snow picked up, so I stayed and looked longer.
Later this month, Alpine shamans Peter Fischli and David Weiss take over three of Matthew Marks’s Chelsea Galleries.

The three Charles Ray installations at Matthew Marks right now, all brilliant examples of post-minimalist/conceptual sculpture, each created in the late eighties and new to New York, rattled my perceptions, jangled my faculties, and made me go “Wow!
But having the three galleries in a row rather than on different streets (as is the case with Gagosian’s multiple spaces, or Matthew Marks’s) is problematic.
