In a serene floor-to-ceiling-painted room of violet, pink, and purple flowers, ferns, and trees — it’s like a surround Monet — we see Ofili unleashing all his painterly powers, tapping into art-historical sources as varied as Art Nouveau, Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, Bob Thompson, German Expressionism, Gauguin, and Matisse.
Instead, there are strange traces of all sorts of art-historical DNA, including Jazz Age graphics, various early-twentieth-century modernist styles, Lyonel Feininger, stained glass, Ludwig Kirchner, Romare Bearden, Art Nouveau, Jacob Lawrence, and Bob Thompson.
As seen in this hippie theme park, psychedelic art is a set of tendencies that includes artists and isms like Beardsley, Klimt, Alphonse Mucha, Louis Sullivan, rococo, Pre-Raphaelitism, Art Nouveau, Dada, Surrealism, Pop, and Op.
