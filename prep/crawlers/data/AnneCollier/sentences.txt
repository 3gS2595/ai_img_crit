Especially impressive are Sturtevant’s room of art that looks like Duchamp’s work but throws representation out the window; Dorothy Iannone’s video of herself climaxing (as she says, “The one fleeting moment when you can see the soul as it passes over the face”); Billy Sullivan’s heartrending Nan Goldin–like slide show depicting an afternoon in a life and a whole life simultaneously; Robert Gober’s journey into hatred; Angela Strassheim’s penetrating photographs of people who are living more for the next life than this one; Jonathan Horowitz’s 19 portraits of the 9-11 hijackers placed surreptitiously throughout the museum; photos by Florian Maier-Aichen, Zoe Strauss, and Anne Collier; Trisha Donnelly’s blasting sound piece.
That’s not enough for this show at this time in this place, especially when many of the better artists here are women (e.g., Kristin Baker, Misaki Kawai, Wangechi Mutu, Michelle Segre, Swoon, Anne Collier, Chie Fueki, Aida Ruilova, Laurel Nakadate, Huma Bhabha, Kate Gilmore, and Karyn Olivier).
