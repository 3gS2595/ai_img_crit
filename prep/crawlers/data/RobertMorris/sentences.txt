We’d get a sense of what a copycat Robert Morris was, how soon Jim Dine started repeating himself, how Warhol was something that had never existed before, how out-of-it many Americans were, or why Barnett Newman’s colleagues felt so betrayed by his work when he first started showing.
Or witness Joseph Beuys’s felt suit transformed into department-store display next to Robert Morris’s felt wall work.
How about Robert Morris, Hans Haacke, Carrie Mae Weems, Kenny Scharf, Martha Rosler, Tony Oursler, Mary Kelly, or any three conceptualists?

Combined with semi-abstract shapes that evoke minimalists and post-minimalists like Donald Judd, Keith Sonnier, and his teacher Robert Morris, these works show Guyton treading water (at best), not really pushing his process, scale, surfaces, or tools, and may be breathing his own fumes a bit too much — not a good place for an artist who depends on, as he once said, looking for “a space where objects could be speculative”.
Even before reading Büchel’s proposal, I could see that these eight looming prototypes looked exactly like minimalistic works of sculpture and environmental interventions made by artists like Richard Serra, Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, Maya Lin, Walter De Maria, Nancy Holt, Donald Judd, James Turrell, Michael Heizer, Tony Smith, and many others.
What’s interesting about the critical rejection of Stella that commences once he moves on from strict Minimalism is that when other early Minimalists, like Robert Morris, moved on, these same critics explained it by saying that Morris and others were working in the “expanded field of sculpture”.
On the one hand, he pushed these technologies beyond their limits in amazing ways, establishing a signature open way of making paintings that proceeded from artists like Reinhardt, Kelly, Warhol, Robert Morris, Dan Flavin, Christopher Wool, and the Pictures Art crowd.
Feeling "underrepresented in the male-run artistic community," artist Lynda Benglis took out a double page ad in the November issue of Artforum, featuring a photo of herself (taken by artist Robert Morris) wearing nothing but a pair of sunglasses, holding a giant dildo to her crotch.
