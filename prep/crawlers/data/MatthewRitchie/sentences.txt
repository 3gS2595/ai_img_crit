Here you’ll learn that in her studio Dana Schutz listens to right-wing radio all night long to get herself “pissed off,” that Gregory Amenoff once hurled an ax at the wall in frustration and that he paints between two huge old speakers (rock on, Gregory), and that Matthew Ritchie, who observes that “monkeys can paint too,” thinks that “graduate schools are a sham and should be abolished straight away”.
Nevertheless, I think artists like Dana Schutz, Matthew Ritchie, Katharina Grosse, and Chris Ofilli, among others, are making use of this bridge, even if none of them profess a specific interest in Murray.
This ties her to such seemingly unrelated artists as Sol LeWitt, Jackie Windsor, Barry Le Va, and Matthew Ritchie—four other systematizers who, despite seeming on top of everything, allow their art to take them in unexpected directions.

Matthew Ritchie is one of my favorite artists, but these seven mid-scale works don’t hold the eye.
Guest curator Matthew Ritchie, himself one of the smartest artists around, forgoes the title of curator (“too professional”) for producer, which sounds just as professional to me, but which Ritchie defines as “being something closer to a pit boss”.
Whatever it is, Edwards strikes a balance between moralizing and hysteria, the pared-down and the psyched-up, while channeling the spirits of Eadweard Muybridge, Al Held, Zaha Hadid, Matthew Ritchie, and Peter Halley.
Architects have nudged around the idea for years, Matthew Ritchie depicts them in his work, and in 1955 Salvador Dalí painted Christ crucified on one.
After his show closes to the public this week, Matthew Ritchie ought to bolt the doors at Andrea Rosen, move in, and spend as much time as he can figuring out how to make good on the promise and possibilities of his fourth solo outing in New York.
Lately, there’s Matthew Barney’s Vaseline-coated drawings of biological impossibility, Matthew Ritchie’s deranged notations of some mythic-scientific dimension, Mark Lombardi’s quasi-paranoid investigations of power and money, Erik Hanson’s gentle meditations on the inner life of listening, and the UFO art of Ionel Talpazan, whose extraordinary exhibition at American Primitive in Soho just closed.
There are still too many undigested references in Essenhigh’s work, among them Jim Nutt, Carl Wirsum, Matthew Ritchie, and Valerio Adami, but her paintings feel authentic and have a nice, if too standardized, no-touch touch.
