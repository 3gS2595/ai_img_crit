CREATE JSON paired with sentences and artist name
    Automate this, each artist has their own folder
    Able to sanitize folders and then run script to generate JSON

    IMAGES NEED TO BE DOWNLOADED BEFORE JSON CREATION
        IMAGES AND SENTENCES DOWNLOADED INTO SAME FOLDER?
        (ASKS BEFORE PROGRAM IS RUN IF YOU'D LIKE TO RE-DOWNLOAD DATA)
        (ELSE JUST CREATES JSON)

TODO
    IDEAS
    - LIMIT THE NUMBER OF ARTISTS THAT ARE ABLE TO BE MENTIONED IN A SENTECE (IMPOSSIBLE FOR AI TO UNDERSTAND)
    - USE SENTENCES THAT COME BEFORE OR AFTER THE SENTENCE THE ARTIST IS MENTIONED IN
