TODO TASKS
    DONE! - ASK THE USER IF IT SHOULD RE-SCRAPE OR JUST GENERATE A NEW JSON FILE
    DONE! - SAVE THE DIC DATA IN ITS OWN FILE AFTER IT RUNS. CANT BELIEVE THIS HASN'T BEEN DONE YET
    DONE! - FIX THE NUMBERING SO THE ID NUMBERS ACTUALLY ARE CORRECT / GO UP

    - REMOVE THE LINE BREAKS IN THE TEXT TO AVOID THE MULTI LINE GARBAGE

TODO IDEAS
    - LIMIT THE NUMBER OF ARTISTS THAT ARE ABLE TO BE MENTIONED IN A SENTENCE (IMPOSSIBLE FOR AI TO UNDERSTAND)
    - USE SENTENCES THAT COME BEFORE OR AFTER THE SENTENCE THE ARTIST IS MENTIONED IN
    - USE SECONDARY AI TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE ARTWORK VS PHOTO (DECIDE IF SALTZ AI SHOULD INCLUDE PHOTOGRAPHERS)
    - THE SAME SENTENCES HAVE DIFFERENT ID'S FOR EACH PHOTO OF THE SMAE ARTIST, KEEP THE SAME ID FOR EACH SENTENCE?
