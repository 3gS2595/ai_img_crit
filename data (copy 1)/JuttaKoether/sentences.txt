Way back in 1990, artist Jutta Koether presciently labeled Krebber a “veteran naysayer”.
Some things just don’t work: Jutta Koether belongs but her installation feels forced; paintings by JP Munro, Spencer Sweeney, Todd Norsten, Chris Vasell, and Monica Majoli are unimpressive to say the least.
Yet even those who don’t know the backstory seem smitten or taken to a place the similarly inspired but slippery Jutta Koether has described as “a field, a passage, and resistance, where desire is transformed .

Some things just dont work: Jutta Koether belongs but her installation feels forced; paintings by JP Munro, Spencer Sweeney, Todd Norsten, Chris Vasell and Monica Majoli are unimpressive to say the least; Nari Ward is good but this wasnt a biennial year for him; Peter Doigs paintings arent up to snuff and look out of place here; Matthew Day Jackson deserves his berth but disappoints; videos by Jim ORourke, Jordan Wolfson and Mathias Poledna are all weak; Paul Chans floor piece is evocative but unoriginal.
