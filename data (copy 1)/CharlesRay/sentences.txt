Formally, he works in a familiar if somewhat surrealistic mode between the material ingenuity of Tom Friedman and the pensive obsessiveness of his former teacher Charles Ray.
Many of Charles Ray’s sculptures work because they’re so fake they’re real; they stand out and change perceptions.
) Albenda’s also in step with a number of contemporaries who aren’t as critical of the white cube—artists like Charles Ray, Olafur Eliasson, Jorge Pardo, Glen Seator, and maybe Vanessa Beecroft, who bring a new kind of surrealist wit or decorativeness to their interventions.
The fetishism, infantilism, mannequins, and set-up photography connect Bartlett to a lot of artists: Henry Darger, Hans Bellmer, Degas, Robert Gober, Charles Ray, Jake & Dinos Chapman, Sally Mann, Jock Sturges, Simmons, and Sherman.
He’s as intriguing as Charles Ray, who has been afforded just about the whole nine yards, though Friedman’s ideas are less integrated into his work.
New Guy Artists include space invaders Jason Rhoades and Thomas Hirschhorn; boy scientists Damien Hirst and Olafur Eliasson; merry pranksters Maurizio Cattelan and Carsten Holler; boy-chicks and it-boys like Rob Pruitt or Hiroshi Sunairi; model makers Michael Ashkin and Tim Hawkinson; Landers the elder and Landers the younger; Charles Ray astride the butch-femme fence; likewise Tom Friedman, Jim Isermann, and Dan Peterman (who is between home building, Rirkrit feeding, and a hard place in his Andrea Rosen exhibition).
You never look at a figure by the Chapmans or one of Charles Ray’s mannequins and think, “This is so real”.
Contrast this with Charles Ray’s nearby 2003 Aluminum Girl, an all-white seemingly classical three-quarters sized female nude with infinitely articulated labia majora and labia minora.
After boldly commissioning eminent American artist Charles Ray to design a sculpture to be permanently installed on the public plaza outside the new museum, the Whitney blinked and declined Ray’s proposal.
Compared to good art, “great art is much harder to talk about,” the sculptor Charles Ray has said, speaking of the phantasmagoric work of Robert Gober, the subject of a 40-year retrospective survey at MoMA, called “The Heart Is Not a Metaphor”.
Feature opened on April Fool’s Day 1984 with a show of work by Richard Prince, and was eventually among the first to exhibit the art of Takashi Murakami, Raymond Pettibon, Tom Friedman, Charles Ray, B. Wurtz, Judy Linn, Richard Kern, Lisa Beck, Tom of Finland, and many others.
Charles Ray delivers big-time in this oversize, scale-distorting female mannequin that makes you feel like a bug, a baby, or an alien.
When it opened in 2009, Charles Ray’s incredible hyper-naturalistic stark-white eight-foot high Boy With Frog was installed on the point.
This time, the exhibition was full of installations (Charles Ray’s full-size replica of a bright-red toy fire engine; Coco Fusco in a cage in the courtyard, costumed as a Native American), site-specific sculpture, and video (Matthew Barney as a genital-less satyr).
In 1993, Charles Ray showed one of the best sculptures of that decade or the next, Family Romance, an uncanny rendition of a family of four standing stark naked, all about chest height and the same size.
His group shows are extraordinarily far-reaching, among them the landmark “Helter Skelter,” which in 1992 looked at the dark side of the Golden State, and featured artists like Mike Kelley, Paul McCarthy, Charles Ray, and Llyn Foulkes, who is only now becoming widely recognized.
In fact it turned out to be the most prescient biennial of the last two decades, introducing novel genres of artistic agency and showcasing emergent artists like Matthew Barney, Glenn Ligon, Janine Antoni, Charles Ray, Robert Gober, Charles Atlas, Mike Kelley, and Andrea Fraser.
Kelley, a Detroit native, spent his whole career in Los Angeles, where — with Raymond Pettibon, Paul McCarthy, Catherine Opie, Jennifer Pastor, Charles Ray, and Jason Rhodes — he helped turn the incipient foreboding of Edward Kienholz, Ed Ruscha, Nancy Rubins, and Chris Burden into an all-out acrimonious art of darkness.
It made me wonder at the absence of Charles Ray, whose Ink Line has real life, or the visionary kingdoms in the drawings of Martin Ramírez, or Giacometti, who showed that putting a mark on paper is a way of not going gentle into anything.
The standoff between Charles Ray’s bizarre eight-foot businesswoman and Liza Lou’s beaded sculpture of a gun-toting Pam Grier enacts Koons’s idea of a psycho-sculptural race war.
Speaking of which, at the tip of the Dogana is Charles Ray’s extraordinary Boy With Frog.
The three Charles Ray installations at Matthew Marks right now, all brilliant examples of post-minimalist/conceptual sculpture, each created in the late eighties and new to New York, rattled my perceptions, jangled my faculties, and made me go “Wow!
If Charles Ray’s pint-sized naked nuclear family, owned by the Museum of Modern Art, were placed in the museum’s atrium, viewers might dash up to the permanent collection wondering where such a strange thing comes from.

However, the show, maybe the most memorable of its ilk, proved that New York criticism often gets things initially wrong, and included numerous artists who went on to have major careers, among them Matthew Barney, Janine Antoni, Sophie Calle, Andrea Fraser, Coco Fusco, Rene Green, Byron Kim, Zoe Leonard, Glen Ligon, Jack Pierson, Fred Wilson, Charles Ray, Sadie Benning and Lorna Simpson.
