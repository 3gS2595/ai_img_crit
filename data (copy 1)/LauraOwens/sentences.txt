Photography is almost absent, and painting is weak, although Laura Owens’s buoyant imaginary tree and Elizabeth Peyton’s stunning self-portrait are the two best works in the exhibition.
In fact, a number of his painterly peers— Elizabeth Peyton, Peter Doig, Takashi Murakami, Luc Tuymans, Laura Owens, and Matthew Ritchie, among them—have influenced other artists more with their individual styles.
Abstraction, spliced with fantasy, science, architecture, or whatever, is gathering steam (e.g., Alexander Ross, Benjamin Edwards, Julie Mehretu, Laura Owens, Mamma Anderson, Steve DiBenedetto, Kristin Baker, Jeff Gauntt, and Matthew Ritchie).
De Balincourt’s kaleidoscopic paintings—which exist somewhere between cheesy advertising, illustration, folk art, Verne Dawson, Laura Owens, sign painting, and Indian miniatures—veer dangerously close to the work of San Francisco artist Chris Johanson.
As we know from Guston, and more lately from someone like Laura Owens, this kind of freedom—handled aptly—can be powerful.
If nothing else, it made the realism, eccentricities, subject choices, and painterly styles of artists as diverse as Karen Kilimnik, Elizabeth Peyton, Laura Owens, Sean Landers, Lisa Yuskavage, and John Currin—all of whom were just beginning to show—make more sense than they might have otherwise.
Ditto Laura Owens, who approaches every drawing as an occasion to rethink drawing; Neo Rauch, whose works on paper aren’t that different from his paintings but are so good it doesn’t matter; Barry McGee’s turbocharged wall of drawings; Franz Ackermann’s 34 studies of a walk through Pittsburgh (with provocative titles like Cinema Beirut and Former Trade Center); John Currin, not because his drawings are so good but because they’re so weird; and Elizabeth Peyton, whose drawings aren’t as juicy as her paintings but are still captivating.
Nevertheless, among a number of artists finding their way through the morass, Laura Owens, with her current exhibition at the Gardner Museum in Boston, shows how wily, insolent, and multivalent painting can be in the hands of someone who loves art but who chafes at seriousness and pretentiousness.
As for newish work by Laura Owens, Chris Ofili, John Currin, or Kara Walker—forget it; according to “Open Ends,” they haven’t happened.
Have Camnitzer, Wodiczko, or Haacke (whose contested piece is tepid and academic) made more of a contribution in the last two years than Laura Owens, Alex Bag, Tom Friedman, or Elizabeth Peyton?
He seems to be thinking about how the areas of a Clyfford Still painting fit together, and how in Laura Owens they don’t.
Filling an entire living room wall, it features the names of art-world players and shakers, from Laura Owens, the Chapmans, and Art Club 2000 to Robert Storr, Dave Hickey, and Charles Saatchi.
At the Whitney Museum, Laura Owens, Toyin Ojih Odutola, Bunny Rogers, and Willa Nasatir made the first part of year three in the new building as convincing as the two years before that.
Plus, the additions of Anne Collier and Bernadette Corporation after that, and real-unreal-looking photos by Annette Kelm, and Laura Owens’s impressive flunky paintings, Alex Israel’s self-portrait painting-as-logo, and a number of Klara Liden pieces, including a handmade bench that rests on bundled cardboard boxes and doubles as a slide-projecting sculpture — all of these might lure viewers in for years to come.
Looking around at the statements made by what has been hung, Laura Owens, Nicole Eisenman, Michael Williams, Michaela Eichwald, Kerstin Bratsch, and Joe Bradley all impress.
All this work has readymade references to preapproved, mostly male painters like Albert Oehlen, Christopher Wool, Michael Krebber, Wade Guyton, Laura Owens, and Sergej Jensen*, or to the Minimalism or Pop movements, and of course it all calls up Warhol, Richter, Kippenberger, or Prince.
I think of artists as varied as Pipilotti Rist, Lynda Benglis, Albert Oehlen, Sigmar Polke, and Laura Owens catching glimpses of the possibilities in all this.
