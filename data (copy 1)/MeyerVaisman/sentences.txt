If you liked artists like Sherman, Richard Prince, and Barbara Kruger (all included here), you weren’t supposed to like East Villagers like David Wojnarowicz, Martin Wong, or (God forbid) Rodney Alan Greenblat and Rhonda Zwillinger (none of whom are represented here), who were dissed by artists like Meyer Vaisman, Peter Nagy, and David Robbins (all excised from this show).
Along with fellow yuppie art stars     Peter Halley, Jeff Koons, and Meyer Vaisman, he was a member of the “Fab 4”: for a nanosecond, this quartet led the movement known as Neo-Geo.
