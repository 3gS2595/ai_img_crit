Second, it traces Fraser’s knotty trajectory from being an appropriation artist who, however competent, veered too close to tropes already in use by artists like Louise Lawler, Sherrie Levine, Richard Prince, Martha Rosler, and Adrian Piper, to becoming an intermittently singular maker of something abberant, deeper, and complicated.
Fletcher’s walk-in documentary/hell-house is as coolly factual as Hans Haacke, as eagle-eyed as Louise Lawler, as pointed as Martha Rosler, and as offhand as Nan Goldin.
She crosses this with the way Louise Lawler’s photographs essentially say, “Look at the way ‘they’ hang ‘their’ art in ‘their’ museums,” then introduces the socially constructed sexual roles in Cindy Sherman’s “Film Stills”.
Despite continued connections to conceptualists like Prince, John Baldessari, and Ray Johnson, and institutional-critique types like Louise Lawler and Dara Birnbaum, “Hair in the Gate,” as this exhibition is called, is a step toward a more personal aesthetic.
Look carefully at Carissa Rodriguez’s handsome silent film of tony interiors and sculptures by Constantin Brancusi as it morphs into a filmic Louise Lawler exploration of various rich collectors who own editions of the same Sherrie Levine–appropriated Brancusi sculpture; The Maid, as the work is titled, becomes riveting in its insinuation of cookie-cutter collector taste and what goes into maintaining this system of wealth and accumulation.

The 2016 Kai Althoff survey and current Louise Lawler exhibition look like the first shows ever at MoMA that feel like they were in the artists’ hands and not an administration brain trust.

Louise Lawler's Marie + 180 Metro Pictures Since we’re on Degas, a well-known Pictures Artist riffing on him (Lawler’s work typically involves rephotographing other work and warping or resizing the image) triggers pictorial memories of one of the most peculiar pieces of modern sculpture ever made.
She and her female contemporaries (Louise Lawler, Sherrie Levine, Barbara Kruger, Laurie Simmons, and a few others) “weren’t accepted in the guys’ world, so we found this whole other way to create”.
My mind did lovely loop-de-loops between thinking, listening, singing along, and puzzling; I also saw this as a direct bridge to Louise Lawler’s marvelous recording of bird calls using only the names of male artists.
Sarah Charlesworth tore up magazines to show us why we desired what we desired; Louise Lawler was a spy in the house of art, taking pictures of work by male artists installed in posh collections; Laurie Simmons created sicko domestic interiors; Barbara Kruger performed shock therapy on advertising; Sherrie Levine, who said, “Appropriation is not all that different from wanting to appropriate your father’s wife or your mother’s husband,” rephotographed famous photographs.
“Who’s Afraid” is like some mad replicating vision machine, or a walk-in Louise Lawler.
