Unraveled Tapestry    Eve Sussman loses the thread of a masterpieceTwo videos made waves in June 2004.
Andrea Fraser’s one-hour tape of her having sex with a collector and Eve Sussman’s 89 Seconds at Alcazar, a dreamy 10-minute reenactment of the events leading up to Diego Velázquez’s towering masterpiece Las Meninas, took the art world by storm as part of that year’s otherwise only OK Whitney Biennial.

Eve Sussman’s 10-minute video, 89 Seconds at Alcázar, a dreamy re-creation of the events preceding and following Velázquez’s perfect moment, is currently amping up an otherwise only OK Whitney Biennial.
I also really liked Dave Muller’s wall, Erick Swenson’s elegant deer, Harrell Fletcher’s James Joyce video, Andrea Zittel’s kooky study center, Emily Jacir’s Palestinian project, Aïda Ruilova’s bombarding video snippets, the extraordinary music of Antony and the Johnsons, Eve Sussman’s video Velázquez, Deborah Stratman’s film in the Simparch installation, Marina Abramovic’s poignant video, Jim Hodges, Spencer Finch, Yutaka Sone, Catherine Sullivan, and the best yet Central Park sculpture installations.
