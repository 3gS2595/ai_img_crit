Then there are those contemporary artists developing their own visual cosmos like Paul Laffoley, Lane Twitchell, Alice Aycock, Dennis Oppenheim, Barry Le Va, Mel Bochner, Agnes Denes, Will Insley, Beth Campbell, Kim Jones, Douglas Blau, Pedro Barbeito, Danica Phelps, and Benjamin Edwards.
Amy Sillman, James Siena, Mel Bochner, Fred Tomaselli, and Lecia Dole-Recio also look good.
As with post-minimalists and conceptualists like Dorothea Rockburne, Mel Bochner, Barry Le Va, and Sol LeWitt, Siena, 46, contrives rules and follows them.
Stylistically, Lombardi owes much to conceptualists like Mel Bochner and Sol LeWitt.
Reducing art to various essences, taking it to aesthetic ground zeros, LeWitt drew on walls, Barry LeVa ran into them, Mel Bochner measured space, Joseph Kosuth exhibited definitions, Dorothea Rockburne folded paper, and On Kawara counted.
Nearby, the ever insidious Mel Bochner diagrams the museum’s deadest end, the fourth-floor freight elevator.
Eminent in this area are Mel Bochner and Barry LeVa.
Plus, this kind of theoretical/phenomenological space has been mapped by artists such as Mel Bochner (a teacher of Barbeito’s), Will Insley, Sol LeWitt, and Alfred Jensen, not to mention a slew of scientists.
Formally, the work resembles large-scale Robert Smithson, Mel Bochner, or Richard Serra charcoal drawings, but Kim uses her graphs and words to record degrees of her fury — from “acute rage” to “legit rage” to “full on rage” — at there being no interpreters at meetings and fake interpreters on TV, at her family not learning sign language, at fast-food cashiers, at airplane movies without captions, at Uber drivers’ calling rather than texting, and so much more that your heart will break.
There are grids of numbers that look like later-day, homemade versions of post-minimalists, like Mel Bochner and Sol LeWitt; signs in the shape of the thing they’re selling, like a mug of beer, commercial versions of shaped paintings; unaltered manufactured cigarette ads that may have been of interest to Grotjahn for being round (he seems drawn to a lot of circles), or for the ad hoc way they’re installed, for example, by a pushpin; or maybe it’s the shiny, cricked surface.
In measuring out and scaling space, this way Guyton picks up on post-minimalists like Dorothea Rockburne, Barry LeVa, and Mel Bochner, all of whom filled up empty spaces with material that defined, deconstructed, or questioned ideas of art and its marketing.
Vito Acconci, Richard Serra, Joseph Kosuth, Mel Bochner, and Robert Smithson were beginning to make post-minimal and conceptual waves here.
But, MoMA wanted a mighty Richard Serra show, and not, say, a mighty Eva Hesse, Hélio Oiticica, Barry Le Va, or Mel Bochner show (to name four artists of Serras generation), or even, for that matter, a complete Serra survey.
Meanwhile, Barry LeVa ran into them, Mel Bochner measured space, Joseph Kosuth exhibited definitions, Dorothea Rockburne folded paper and On Kawara counted.
Then there are those contemporary artists developing their own visual cosmos like Paul Laffoley, Lane Twitchell, Alice Aycock, Dennis Oppenheim, Barry Le Va, Mel Bochner, Agnes Denes, Will Insley, Beth Campbell, Kim Jones, Douglas Blau, Pedro Barbeito, Danica Phelps and Benjamin Edwards.
