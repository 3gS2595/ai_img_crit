Cameron Martin and Tam Van Tran are passable but not biennial material and David Hockney looks lame, my soft spot for him notwithstanding.
This biennial might have twinkled more had the curators switched a few of the big names for slightly less predictable big names: Mary Heilmann instead of Robert Mangold, Jim Nutt rather than David Hockney, William Eggleston instead of Jack Pierson, Lee Bontecou rather than Alex Hay, and R. Crumb and Cady Noland instead of Paul McCarthy and Richard Prince.
Both are just starting out, especially McHargue, who nevertheless feels like a homegrown Francesco Clemente by way of the early, awkward David Hockney.
Interestingly, this conversion came not as a result of looking at art, but as I watched David Hockney, an artist I’d always considered a lightweight, deliver a dazzling analysis of a 17th-century Chinese scroll in Philip Haas’s marvelous 1989 film, A Day on the Grand Canal With the Emperor of China.
With his illustrative illusionism and cheery color, Grodesky comes off as an edgier, more rigorous David Hockney.
David Hockney is showing up in artists’ work these days.
I remember seeing David Hockney, on film, talk about a 17th-century Chinese scroll, and thinking, “This guy is better than I thought”.
It took place in a warren of rooms on the hotel’s 11th floor and in the famous cabanas surrounding the swimming pool that David Hockney painted with blue squiggles in 1988, which is still there in all its faded magnetism.
Similarly, I saw crowds of people reveling in the wild color of David Hockney, none of whom had to jump through extra hoops to do so.
We see him go to Vermeer’s house in Delft and take pictures of the town, and meet with David Hockney in Yorkshire in order to consult about the theory that Vermeer used a camera obscura to paint.
Needless to say, these are the very things that artists like Kinkade, and of late David Hockney, have railed about when they’re done by Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, or Damien Hirst.
