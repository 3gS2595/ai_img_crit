Nevertheless, “Scream: 10 Artists x 10 Writers x 10 Scary Movies,” the group show at Anton Kern, has caught the zeitgeist.
The gold rush to the area has turned almost all blue-chip (except for maverick Anton Kern’s relocation this week to a ground-floor space on West 20th Street).
In the debut category, gallerist Anton Kern continues his amble toward excellence with solos by parafeminist installationist Monica Bonvicini, who looked enticing in Venice and Berlin last year.
On top of all that, many of the best gallerists today were once those poor people behind desks, among them Gavin Brown, Michele Maccarone, Lisa Cooley, Rachel Uffner, Kathy Grayson, Risa Needleman, Carol Greene, Friedrich Petzel, Anton Kern, and countless others.
Dealers include David Zwirner, Gavin Brown, Andrea Rosen, Matthew Marks, Anton Kern, Marianne Boesky, Paul Morris, Brent Sikkema and Frederic Petzel.
