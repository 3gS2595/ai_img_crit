Maximum VoracityMany of last year’s good solo shows didn’t garner as much attention as they maybe deserved; among them were outings by Joyce Pensato, Benjamin Edwards, Ellen Altfest, Kate Gilmore, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, Stuart Hawkins, Jennifer Dalton, Guy Ben-Ner, Karen Heagle, Judith Linhares, Chris Minor, Halsey Rodman, Tommy White, Keith Mayerson, Joe Fig, Mindy Shapero, and Sara VanDerBeek.

She also connects up to other lunatic edge-workers like Alex Bag, Kate Gilmore, Laurel Nakadate, Xavier Cha, Patti Chang, and Lara Martini, who, for her gripping Open Studios at SVA recently madly dressed and undressed behind a two-way mirror—it was like peering into the heart of a neutron bomb.
That’s not enough for this show at this time in this place, especially when many of the better artists here are women (e.g., Kristin Baker, Misaki Kawai, Wangechi Mutu, Michelle Segre, Swoon, Anne Collier, Chie Fueki, Aida Ruilova, Laurel Nakadate, Huma Bhabha, Kate Gilmore, and Karyn Olivier).
Pressed to list artists who stand out, I’d name Kristin Baker, Wangechi Mutu, Ricci Albenda, Fred Tomaselli, Ward Shelley, Luis Gispert, Elana Herzog, Kirsten Hassenfeld, Phong Bui, Dawn Clements, Diana Cooper, Patricia Cronin, Brady Dollarhide, and Kate Gilmore.
Still, the show will include excellent, newer, below-the-radar artists like performance chaos-creator Aki Sasamoto; Jessica Jackson Hutchins, whose arrangements of objects and ceramics create contradictory cosmic and formal storms; Kate Gilmore, who has been known to smash through Sheetrock walls while wearing party dresses and high heels; and Sharon Hayes, whose 2008 performance of her reading an imaginary letter about love and war on a midtown corner at lunch hour was one of the most moving things I saw that year.
