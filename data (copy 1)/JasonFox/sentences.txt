Other good stoned pieces include Matthew Greene’s obsessive ink drawing (better than the canvases he showed in last winter’s “Scream,” because it’s more personal), and paintings by Tyson Reeder, Sara Clendening, and Jason Fox.
Outsider art and thrift-store painting come to mind, as does ’50s Bay Area figuration, ’70s “Bad Painting,” a hoard of now rightly forgotten ’80s East Village artists, the splintered composition of Cecily Brown and Barnaby Furnas, and the aberrant realism of Jason Fox and Brian Calvin.

Addressing the strangeness, the underrated painter Jason Fox recently observed, “In these conservative times, it’s easy for art to become hollowed out from any progressive or radical energy and exist only as a bourgeois decoration”.
