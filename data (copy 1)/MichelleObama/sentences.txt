Sherald, 46, is the artist who created the portrait of former First Lady Michelle Obama.
Then there’s the portrait of Michelle Obama by Amy Sherald, 44, who lives in Baltimore.
Finally a big Obama bravo to painter Amy Sherald, 44, of Baltimore, plucked from almost-obscurity by Michelle Obama to paint her official portrait.
Self’s more material works echo a promising crop of other young painters of color who are doing similar crackling things more painterly, including recent MacArthur winner Njideka Akunyili Crosby, Toyin Ojih Odutola (whose current Whitney project sizzles), Louis Fratino, Alex Chaves, Nina Chanel Abney, and Amy Sherald, who was all but unknown when she was rightfully picked to paint Michelle Obama’s official portrait.
This was to be the first biennial in a brand-new, beautiful downtown building dedicated to these progressive truths which the art world holds to be self-evident (and which Michelle Obama, in fact, had helped inaugurate).
In addition to super-patron and Zen believer in the arts Flora Miller Biddle — granddaughter of the museum’s founder, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney — sitting on stage on Gansevoort Street, looking toward the new museum, were Mayor de Blasio (a better speaker than I thought); Whitney architect Renzo Piano, who began his speech looking around at all of this, saying, “Mamma mia,” and everyone in eyeshot nodded in agreement; director Adam Weinberg, who, with his deputy, Donna De Salvo, should be given keys to the city, or at least a lifetime MTA pass; some other Whitney mucky-mucks who helped make all this possible; and America’s First Lady, Michelle Obama — glorious, glamorous, and speaking truth to power in ways I don’t think I could have imaged one hour earlier.
He announced that if this work were to sell on eBay, he’d do one of Michelle Obama and her “little abs,” and put it in a Dos Equis beer bottle.
