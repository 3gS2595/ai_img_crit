You begin to get that she is nervily trying to combine the verve of Mitchell, the analytic painting-is-part-of-the-world conceptualism of Sol LeWitt, and the hardcore graphicness of Christopher Wool.
Christopher Wool is the New York painter West Coast critics love to hate—and I mean hate.
David ReedMax Protetch511 West 22nd StreetThrough December 23 A funny thing happened on my way to review the Christopher Wool show.
Sue Williams’s notations and diagrams are read as sequential (like a comic book); in Christopher Wool’s work, word and letter are the image.
Price opens with a balletic dance of white-gloved workers hastening about the immaculate showrooms of Sotheby’s auction house, moving art around tony galleries, paintings by Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Rudolf Stingel, Richard Prince, Jasper Johns, Gerhard Richter, Takashi Murakami, Banksy, Christopher Wool, and many other usual market suspects.
I saw Richard Prince, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Gladstone, Gavin Brown, John Currin, James Nares, Duncan Hannah, Max Blagg, Clarissa Dalrymple, Bob Colacello, Edit DeAk, Walter Robinson, Lisa Rosen, Christopher Wool, Warhol personages, and O’Brien’s last muse and wife, Gina Nanni.
An irregularly shaped ten-foot tall, 86-foot-long rectangle of oil on  canvas and aluminum, a shiny gaudy thing — we go from the tail of the  supersonic fighter and a proto–Christopher Wool silk-screen pattern of  flowery wallpaper serving as the jet exhaust, to a giant tractor tire  tread, pound cake, geometric abstract painting here and there, maybe an  overhead shot of a cockpit or runway, a woman under a space-helmet-like  hair-dryer, the initials USA, a beach umbrella, mushroom cloud,  splatters of spaghetti as allusion to Abstract Expressionism and pizza  pie, some sea creature or blue cauliflower, weird wallpaper pattern to  the aluminum surface and nosecone of the warplane.
In their collection are artists like Prince, Joe Bradley, Christopher Wool, Nate Lowman, Alex Da Corte, Alex Israel, Dan Colen, and many other very famous artists.
By 1990 artists like Jeff Koons, Rachel Whiteread, Chris Ofili, Gabriel Orozco, Andreas Gursky, Christopher Wool, Noland, and Damien Hirst appeared.
This is even more important in this time when museums can’t afford to collect contemporary art at all and instead must collect collectors to survive at all, when most museums’ annual acquisition budgets can’t even cover the price of, say, one Christopher Wool painting.
If you’re still cynically thinking, Yeah, but they’re still just more rich people buying famous art, as much as I loathe reducing art to prices, they paid $50 for their first Cindy Sherman, $7,500 for their first Christopher Wool, and $5,600 for their first Jeff Koons, a vacuum-cleaner sculpture they saw in the same Maiden Lane studio I saw it in — and still regret not keeping the ballpoint-pen drawing of an inflatable bunny he drew for me during that visit.
There are squiggles sometimes, maybe Christopher Wool–like black screen, or Sigmar Polke–like dots here and there.
Making the sale all the more irritating, the market is now so distorted and tilted toward contemporary art that $14 million raised from the auction of a Monet is less than the cost of a large work by a contemporary art star like Gerhard Richter, Jeff Koons, Christopher Wool, Peter Doig, and many others.
) Spellman’s East Village space, opened in 1986, was where Christopher Wool showed his epic Apocalypse Now painting, in an exhibition co-curated by Wool, for Spellman, with a young artist named Robert Gober who’d been showing at the role model for all things Spellman — and maybe all things good in the art world — Paula Cooper.
And all the work looks more or less the same, a cross between Christopher Wool, Wade Guyton, some constructivism or minimalism, all by way of the abstract drips and speckle patterns of zombie painting.
Inside, this magic bus is tricked out with art-world tchotchkes and keepsakes — trinkets like a baby bib with a Christopher Wool text emblazoned on it or Vito Acconici lube.
Martin glides in slo-mo past art featured in the sale: work by Christopher Wool, Wade Guyton, Richard Prince, Jeff Koons, Dan Colen, Cady Noland, John Currin, and other blue-chip names.
On the one hand, he pushed these technologies beyond their limits in amazing ways, establishing a signature open way of making paintings that proceeded from artists like Reinhardt, Kelly, Warhol, Robert Morris, Dan Flavin, Christopher Wool, and the Pictures Art crowd.
Tonight, sometime after 7 p.m., Christopher Wool’s signature 1988 work, Apocalypse Now, will be auctioned at Christie’s, and estimates for the selling price are in the $10 to 15 million range; the last week or so has seen similarly record-high contemporary art purchases.
In the catalogue accompanying Christopher Wool’s impressive retrospective now at the Guggenheim, the artist Richard Prince writes of this artist’s multiple uses of “spray-­painted swirls … transfer drips, splatters, puddles, and ‘by-the-by’ patterns,” and how they “taught an old dog new tricks”.
All this work has readymade references to preapproved, mostly male painters like Albert Oehlen, Christopher Wool, Michael Krebber, Wade Guyton, Laura Owens, and Sergej Jensen*, or to the Minimalism or Pop movements, and of course it all calls up Warhol, Richter, Kippenberger, or Prince.

And in this piece, you can see how marvelously alive and prescient she was; its spray-painted enamel geometries and pictorial attitude predict artists like Christopher Wool and Albert Oehlen”as well as countless graffiti painters in the seventies.
In the last years of the boom, numerous artists came to the fore who have their aesthetic heads up the aesthetic asses of Gerhard Richter, Andy Warhol, Richard Prince, Cady Noland, and Christopher Wool.
Pensato spikes her mix with the black-and-white starkness of Christopher Wool and the defiant abjection of Joan Jett’s “I Hate Myself for Loving You”.
