Galleries included 303, International With Monument, Nature Morte, Cash-Newhouse, Pat Hearn, and American Fine Arts, which was run by the late pirate prince Colin de Land, and closed only last month.
Looking very Lost Illusions are such “players‘‘ as Spencer Sweeney, Colin de Land, Rachel Harrison (wearing, I must say, an Electro T-shirt I also own), and a certain Miss Sissel Kardel, a striking blond sitting by her paintings.
I don’t remember where or when, but I once read that the great artist, filmmaker, and true national treasure John Waters said of the late, equally great gallerist Colin de Land of American Fine Arts, “Colin broke the curse of fame for me”.
It was in her space on Spring and Greene Streets, where she moved in 1989, early in the wave of good East Village gallerists like Pat Hearn and Colin de Land decamping to Soho, that Rirkrit Tiravanija staged his early cooking pieces.
At first he might be placed in the class of gypsy-dreamboat super-intelligent anti-gallerists like Colin de Land, Gavin Brown, and Michele Maccarone.
We’ve seen Brown (“Meeting him was huge, like Brian Epstein and the Beatles”) and the late gallerist Colin de Land.
While its super-hipness can get on your nerves, it is still an excellent test site, in the tradition of the late Colin de Land’s American Fine Arts.
