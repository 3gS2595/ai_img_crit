There’s the fabulous Seated Nude With Pearls, a calendar-girl image of a Picabia-esque tart suggestively toying with her necklace; Seated Nude on a Diving Board, a primitive picture of a demure George Washington look-alike; Bathing Beauty, a pinup in a bubble bath; the cuckoo Woman in Champagne Glass; and a chesty blond in a mini-dress holding a blue dog head.
Made between 1926 and 1931, when Calder, the son and grandson of artists (his father sculpted the George Washington on the Washington Square Arch, his grandfather the colossal statue of William Penn atop Philadelphia’s City Hall), was in his late 20s and early 30s, living in Paris, and hanging around with the likes of Picasso, Miró, Mondrian, Léger, and all the other European modernist heavyweights.
