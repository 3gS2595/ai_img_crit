Within weeks, Hilton Kramer and Peter Plagens took issue.
Gaudy statements like these have done much to turn Giacometti into what Hilton Kramer, in 1963, rightly and derisively called an “existential saint”.
The work was panned as “shallow” and “boring” by the Times’ Hilton Kramer, while in Time, Robert Hughes said they “hardly exist within the sphere of aesthetic debate”.
New York Times critic Hilton Kramer lambasted Guston as “a mandarin pretending to be a stumblebum,” dismissing the work as “cartoon anecdotage … funky, clumsy and demotic,” and concluding “We are asked to take seriously his new persona as an urban primitive … and this is asking too much”.
Hilton Kramer — referring to the biennial’s one African-American curator, Thelma Golden — said there was an “awful logic in having Ms. Golden on the curatorial team”.
Referring to the Biennial’s one African-American curator, Hilton Kramer hissed, “There is a certain awful logic in having Ms. [Thelma] Golden on the curatorial team”.
PHILIP GUSTON, THE STUDIO, 1969 When the Abstract Expressionist Guston showed paintings of art materials and oafish Klansmen, he was panned—Hilton Kramer called him “a mandarin pretending to be a stumblebum”—but young New York artists understood that a new type of figuration was in the air.
The ever-cantankerous Hilton Kramer chastised the exhibition’s organizer for making Johns “look like a bore” and catalogue author Michael Crichton for “making him sound like an ass,” but ArtForum’s Rosalind Krauss dissented, describing an experience akin to “watching a poetic world notching piece by piece into place, seeing a universe of feeling slowly exfoliate from a restricted supply of imagery”.
The show is universally panned by critics, including grouchy conservative Hilton Kramer, who in the New York Times famously dismissed Guston as "a mandarin pretending to be a stumblebum".
