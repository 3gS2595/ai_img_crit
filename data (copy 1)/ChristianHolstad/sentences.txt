I’d split “Best in Show” among Christian Holstad, Brian Belott, and Devendra Banhart (who really shines in a lovely three-person show at Canada).
(And they missed artists like Sue Williams, Christian Holstad, Janine Antoni, Jason Middlebrook, Karen Heagle, and Cheney Thompson, among other worthies.
Standouts in this piecemeal kingdom are David Altmejd, Eric Wesley, Mark Handforth, possibly Christian Holstad and Matthew Ronay, and certainly Julianne Swartz, whose stairwell installation fills the air with the sounds of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”.
There are ingenious bark drawings by Pygmy women of the Ituri Rainforest at Nolan/Eckman, some visionary zingers made by self-taught Russians at Galerie St. Étienne, the studies of Marsden Hartley at Babcock, the simple but sweet found book pages of Matthew Higgs at Murray Guy, impressive shows by Christian Holstad and Anthony Burdin at Daniel Reich and Maccarone respectively, and a superb survey of Thomas Nozkowski’s drawings at the New York Studio School (8 West 8th Street, through March 1) that tracks this late bloomer’s steadfast development from tardy postminimalist to explorer of form to the consummate draftsman and balancer of tactfulness, tightness, and offhandedness he has become.
A few blocks away, Daniel Reich, the former director of Pat Hearn, who has been staging excellent exhibitions out of his teensy West 21st Street ground-floor apartment for over a year, is showing an installation by Christian Holstad, consisting of a walk-in, plastic-draped bedroom decorated with torrid, meticulously crafted drawings and collages.
Christian Holstad, Derek Jarman and Mika Tajima at X Initiative: Phase I, 548 West 22nd Street, New York, N.Y. 10011.
