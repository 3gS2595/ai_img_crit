Hannah Wilke was a beauty, Lynda Benglis a babe, and Carolee Schneemann, Karen Finley, and Annie Sprinkle all show their big breasts as often as possible.
When Lynda Benglis attacked the macho image of the artist by posing naked with a dildo in Artforum (November 1974), Annette Michelson and Rosalind Krauss (who called the picture “vulgar,” “disgusting,” and “the last straw”) resigned from the magazine.
Warhol’s swishiness was revolutionary; so was Lynda Benglis posing naked with a double-headed dildo and Cindy Sherman disappearing into her film stills.
It’s an extended rendition of Lynda Benglis’s famous 1970s paint spills on the ground, and embodies what Brian Eno meant when he wrote, “Abandon normal instructions; Repetition is a form of change; Emphasize the flaws”.
I think of artists as varied as Pipilotti Rist, Lynda Benglis, Albert Oehlen, Sigmar Polke, and Laura Owens catching glimpses of the possibilities in all this.
• Lynda Benglis’s impressive that’s-not-a-dildo-that’s-art-dear New Museum retrospective.
Downstairs from Condo’s show at the New Museum is the radically fabulous survey of Lynda Benglis — whose work from 1969 to 1975 is so fecund, fresh, relevant, and prescient that she saves the day, letting you see that she predicts numerous contemporary artists from Urs Fischer and Isa Genzken to Rachel Harrison and Franz West.
They’re where de Kooning, Rodin, and Lynda Benglis meet Frankenstein, Warhol’s floating silver pillows, and the hatchery from Aliens.
It is one of the most seductively rebellious artistic gestures since Lynda Benglis’s notorious Artforum ad in 1974, for which she posed naked wielding a dildo.
Where are the surveys of Lynda Benglis, Dorothea Rockburne, Adrian Piper, and Sturtevant?
Those doors crack open as well in Jedediah Caesar’s Larry Bell–meets–Donald Judd–meets–Lynda Benglis block of iridescent Styrofoam—another work with an unpredictable surface and hard-to-determine reasoning.
Lynda Benglis ties canvas in knots, Jackie Winsor lashes logs together with twine to make a Paleolithic stretcher, Dorothea Rockburne creates chipboard grids (a Rockburne survey is overdue), and Lee Bontecou quite simply presents what looks like the mouth of hell, the eye of a Cyclops, the surface of the moon, and a vagina dentata in a relief painting that still has the power to terrify, entice, and awe.
There are excellent paintings on hand, notably Peter Saul’s heaving depiction of a Vietnamese woman being raped by American soldiers, Lynda Benglis’s latex floor splat, and Jimi Hendrix’s Sigmar Polke–like abstraction.
At the National Academy you can see how Lynda Benglis became a female Pollock by simply pouring latex paint on the floor to make psychedelic pancakes, Ron Gorchov made painting almost primitive in his curved shield-shapes, and Harmony Hammond returned the medium to its medicinal roots with circular floor mandalas made of fabric.

 Lynda Benglis’ impressive that’s-not-a-dildo-that’s-art-dear New Museum retrospective.
It’s probably an homage to another  stunner, Lynda Benglis’  tremendously influential 1969 poured-­pigment painting, Baby Contraband, which sits on a floor here; you can almost feel the frisson as the artist  breaks painting out of its historical-spatial confines.
