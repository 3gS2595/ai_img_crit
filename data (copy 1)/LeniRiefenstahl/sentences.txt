“Exotica” is a bizarre Leni Riefenstahl–like grande dame in a gold gown.
Currently, several shows stand out, including Katharina Fritsch’s almost too perfect Albert Speer-meets-Leni Riefenstahl one-liner of an installation at Matthew Marks, made of over 400,000 glittering silver-colored coins in the shape of a giant heart.
At the grand, terrifying end to this show—just yards from Olympia, Leni Riefenstahl’s ode to Teutonic superiority—is the work of one of Hitler’s favorite painters, Adolf Ziegler.
Other images update Kurosawa’s pageantry and Triumph of the Will, Leni Riefenstahl’s 1935 film of the Nuremberg rallies.
