Saville seems to have realized this too; or maybe she just needed to change up her art so that here, with these paintings, which break into some new territory, she’s involved with a flatter, more imagistic and surreal fracturing of her models that recalls George Condo and Francis Bacon — but that still have a long way to go to be in the least bit gripping.
