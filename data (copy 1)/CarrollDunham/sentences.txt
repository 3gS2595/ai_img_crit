By now I no longer know if I like Carroll Dunham’s paintings because we’re friends or if we’re friends because I like his paintings.
In effect, each painting is producing, describing, and—as painter Carroll Dunham brilliantly said of work like this—”remembering itself”.
There’s also the corner with Mary Kelly’s pregnant belly as a Sol LeWitt–like grid with implications of the birth canal delivered via Nauman’s nearby narrow-corridor video; and the abject-meets-the-Apollonian alcove of Louise Bourgeois, Sue Williams, Carroll Dunham, and Paul McCarthy.
When pressed about who these women are by painter Carroll Dunham in the catalog’s marvelous cat-and-mouse interview, Nutt ducks, saying, “They just evolve out of the process”.
Her animated, painterly touch suggests Guston’s late paintings, and what Malcolm Morely, Peter Saul, Elizabeth Murray, Carroll Dunham, and Chris Ofili do when they’re on.

As artist Carroll Dunham said, “You are not in the presence of artful thought”.
His patchwork composition portends artists like Rauschenberg, Polke, and Basquiat, while his intoxicated, comic book style and sexual imaginings predict everyone from Peter Saul and Jim Shaw to Amy Sillman and Carroll Dunham.
There’s not a single canvas by Julian Schnabel, David Salle, Elizabeth Murray, Eric Fischl, Terry Winters, Joan Snyder, Lari Pittman, Carroll Dunham, Peter Halley, or Philip Taaffe.
Accompanying this show is a doozy of an interview with the painter Carroll Dunham.
An uneven array of painters will be on view, among them John Currin, Carroll Dunham, Jonathan Lasker, Nicola Tyson, Lari Pittman, Lily van der Stokker, Elliott Puckett, Thomas Scheibitz, Diana Cooper, Pet Sourin-thone, Paul Laffoly, John Wesley, David Reed, Frank Stella, and finally the exuberantly Hartley-esque David Bates, about whom Gary Indiana wrote one of the funniest, cruelest, and most unforgettable lines of art criticism, in his Voice review of the 1987 Whitney Biennial: “David Bates?
Carroll Dunham makes known his enthusiasm for the art of Alan Turner, whose merging faces and other body parts are a bit like a realist version of Dunham’s own sexually charged, mutating forms.
He was just about to publish a compilation of ’80s art, called Beyond Boundaries, in which, when it came out, he reproduced one of my husband Carroll Dunham’s paintings upside down.
Artists like Jenna Gribbon, Louis Fratino, Carroll Dunham, Sarah Peters, and Jonathan Lyndon Chase actually cross the beams of modernism with motives on Greek vases.
The list of artists influenced by this incredible work includes Nicole Eisenman, Amy Sillman, Albert Oehlen, Carroll Dunham, Elizabeth Murray, and Georg Baselitz, who saw as early as 1959 that Guston was involved with “a distortion of the abstract … full of concrete forms”.
As artist Carroll Dunham put it, “It was like seeing Henry Darger selling his work on the street”.
The first time her work was ever seen outside her native New Zealand gave us fabulous graphite and colored-pencil, crayon, and ink conglomerations of Donald Duck, Willem de Kooning, Jim Nutt, Roy Lichtenstein, and Carroll Dunham.
Included are strange abstract combinations or knitted-together landscapes of cartoon parts, notably Donald Duck, arranged in ways that echo Willem de Kooning, Jim Nutt’s meticulous piecing together of body parts and distortion, Roy Lichtenstein’s stylized cartooning, and Carroll Dunham’s deft space and line.

The contemporary American artist Carroll Dunham, in fact, says he’s the greatest of all: “No artist of our time, and certainly no artist working on painting, is more significant than Sigmar Polke”.
