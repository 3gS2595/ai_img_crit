At the moment two local shows exemplify this chaos theory: Jon Kessler’s  whirling-dervish CNN inferno at P.S.1, which is desperate in ways that respond to our quasi-desperate times, and Mike Kelley’s high school/hell house/Lawrence Welk extravaganza at Gagosian, which seems desperate for its own sake but still finds Kelley attempting to deepen his familiar themes.
Forerunners to the present moment include Cady Noland, Karen Kilimnik, Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Paul McCarthy, and the abject art of the early ’90s.
The abjectness of the narrative and the materials connects Leo to Mike Kelley—someone she may not care about, but who is surely an influence on her and a number of younger artists.
Using actors—as he does in Painter, Santa, and his so-so collaborations with Mike Kelley, Heidi and Fresh Acconci—is a great idea for McCarthy.
From the abject installations of Karen Kilimnik and Mike Kelley, to the realistic paintings and sculptures of Eric Fischl, Amy Adler, Jim Shaw, and Robert Gober, to the diaristic photographs of Wolfgang Tillmans, Nan Goldin, and Richard Billingham, artists have contemplated their origins, the subcultures of youth, and coming-of-age.
Mike Kelley, Tony Oursler, and Jim Shaw belong to this brotherhood, as do Stephen Prina, David Robbins, and Christopher Williams.
Unlike fellow Californians Jim Shaw, who simply collected thrift-store paintings and displayed them, or Mike Kelley, who used cast-off stuffed animals in his art, Grotjahn puts his obsession through an extraordinary transformation so that we don’t know if the final object is art, a doppelgänger, an original, a copy, a hoax, or bad politics.
Magpie-eyed artist Jim Shaw has spent most of his career in the shadows of his good friends and colleagues Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy.
) In “Thrift Store Paintings,” Shaw followed in the footsteps of greats like Duchamp, Picabia, Enrico Baj, Asger Jorn, and Jean Dubuffet, and, closer to the present, Martin Kippenberger, Mike Kelley, and others who either altered ready-made paintings, presented them as unmediated material that needed to be seen, or just went and commissioned paintings by others (pace Kippenberger and John Baldessari).
Some of these boldfaced names range relatively far afield: Miley Cyrus has gone big into sculpture (and was compared by art impresario Jeffrey Deitch to Mike Kelley), and last year, Jay Z took a page from Marina Abramovic’s performance act (full disclosure: I sort of fell for it).
Until the closing day of Mike Kelley at PS1.
• Mike Kelley’s 1980s felt paintings at Skarstedt are absolutely smashing.

”At the peak of these personal mountains is the late Mike Kelley’s tremendous three-and-a-half-hour unfinished Whitney Biennial film.

Right now, at the SculptureCenter, you can see a rollicking, mind-blowing installation by Mike Kelley and Michael Smith.

) Most of Pinault’s art is about the market, and is made by market darlings: Richard Prince, Mike Kelley, Rudolf Stingel, Marlene Dumas, Luc Tuymans, Takashi Murakami.

Among many standouts, however, are Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster’s petting-zoo-like installation of scaled-down works of other Münster artists, Mike Kelley’s actual petting zoo, Hans-Peter Feldmann’s sprucing up of two public restrooms, Guy Ben-Ner’s reconstructed bicycle project, Susan Philipsz’s haunting recorded aria under a bridge, and Pawel Althamer’s winding path through parks and fields.
