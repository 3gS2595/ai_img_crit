After five desultory years under other leadership, the Whitney cleaned house in 2003, hiring new director Adam Weinberg, who brought on a number of excellent people, including associate director Donna De Salvo from Tate Modern.
Because of the maverick feel that Donna De Salvo, chief curator and associate director for programs, has for space and for juxtaposing works of art, attentive viewers will get a fresh, even electric understanding not only of some of the art in the Whitney’s collection but even the Whitney itself.
In addition to super-patron and Zen believer in the arts Flora Miller Biddle — granddaughter of the museum’s founder, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney — sitting on stage on Gansevoort Street, looking toward the new museum, were Mayor de Blasio (a better speaker than I thought); Whitney architect Renzo Piano, who began his speech looking around at all of this, saying, “Mamma mia,” and everyone in eyeshot nodded in agreement; director Adam Weinberg, who, with his deputy, Donna De Salvo, should be given keys to the city, or at least a lifetime MTA pass; some other Whitney mucky-mucks who helped make all this possible; and America’s First Lady, Michelle Obama — glorious, glamorous, and speaking truth to power in ways I don’t think I could have imaged one hour earlier.
But Weinberg and his team — most notably, chief curator and deputy director Donna De Salvo, and curator and associate director Scott Rothkopf — are also operating under unusual terms, thanks to the unusual mission of the museum, which is the third reason the Whitney seems so well suited to the new era.
)Not only did the Whitney say good-bye to its storied building in the grand manner of the Koons show, but it had a pretty great year of temporary exhibitions featuring a probing show of the museum’s permanent collection (an art-world-wide shout-out is due the museum’s chief curator and deputy director of programs, Donna De Salvo, for overseeing this excellent extended series of shows).
No sooner had they been named, however, than Whitney director Adam Weinberg pulled back the reins, announcing that the two would be “overseen” by the museum’s chief curator, Donna De Salvo, and that they’d “worked with” the advisers Thelma Golden, Bill Horrigan, and Linda Norden.
Director Adam Weinberg and curator–associate director Donna De Salvo have largely stopped the museum’s slide into corporateness, mounting relevant shows of living artists and overseeing intelligent installations of the permanent collection.
Four candidates come immediately to mind: the chief curator and associate director for programs at the Whitney, Donna De Salvo; the current director of UCLA’s Hammer Museum, Ann Philbin; the departing director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Kathy Halbreich; and the Studio Museum in Harlem’s Thelma Golden.
Regardless, no sooner had Huldisch and Momin been named than Whitney director Adam Weinberg pulled back the reins, announcing that the two would be "overseen" by the museums chief curator, Donna De Salvo, and that theyd "work with" three older "advisers," Thelma Golden, Bill Horrigan and Linda Norden.
