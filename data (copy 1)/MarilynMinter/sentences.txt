Other standouts included Dasha Shishkin, Jackie Saccoccio, Seth Price, Thomas Hirschhorn, Marilyn Minter, Josiah McElheny, Cheney Thompson, Wade Guyton, Aaron Young, Harrell Fletcher, Mark Grotjahn, and perhaps best of all, the exhibition by the living lord of chaos, Sigmar Polke.
Marilyn Minter had a tough mid 1990s.
Good paintings are present, notably by Mark Grotjahn, Mark Bradford, Rudolf Stingel, and Marilyn Minter.
In this arena there’s Janine Antoni’s powerful photographic transformations of her parents, Hannah Wilke’s harrowing record of her mother’s battle with cancer, Matthew Barney casting his mom as a man, Richard Billingham’s social work as art, Patti Chang’s creepy kisses with her parents, Marilyn Minter’s monstrous epiphany of her mother in bed, and, at Boesky right now, Anneè Olofsson’s photos of her father with his hands under her sweater.
Marilyn Minter says, “I don’t care if people buy [my paintings], I just need to make them”.
Marilyn Minter, “Pretty/Dirty”Brooklyn Museum (ongoing)No one nails the nexus of bawdy sex, gaudy beauty, gorgeous surface, and electric, eye-popping color like Marilyn Minter.
Whatever it will be, it’s scheduled to open in February with an exhibition organized by the artist Marilyn Minter called “The Virgin Show”.
As Minter wrote to me, “all the artists have never shown before ( they probably are still virgins too) and it is curated by Marilyn Minter who just happens to be a virgin”.
