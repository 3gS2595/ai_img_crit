Even so, MOMA’s narrative wouldn’t be disrupted by having work on view by Alice Neel, Florine Stettheimer, Sonia Delaunay, Louise Nevelson, Emma Kunz, Hilma af Klint, Adrian Piper, Marisol, Maya Deren, Dorthea Rockburne, Niki de Saint Phalle, Jo Baer, Jay DeFeo, Joan Brown, Grace Hartigan, Leonora Carrington, Leonor Fini, Natalia Goncharova, Gego, Dorothea Tanning, Romaine Brooks, Ree Morton, Howardena Pindell, Lee Lozano, Hanna Hoch, and Claude Cahun.
Paintings by Leonor Fini, Frida Kahlo (each sadly represented by only two canvases), Carrington (who currently lives in Mexico), and Tanning (who lives in New York) look extremely fresh, and are revelations of pictorial ambition and female fantasy.
Add to this a whiff of Thomas Hart Benton, superhero comics, Popular Science magazine, women’s prison films, World War II illustration, lesser-known surrealists like Leonora Carrington and Leonor Fini, and affinities with contemporaries like Tim Gardner and Jim Shaw, and you’ve got a genuinely oddball mix.
