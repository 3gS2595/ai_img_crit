There’s Amerigo Vespucci, covered in psychedelic measles; John Locke, who wrote about “combining several simple ideas into one compound,” which is a good description of what Harrison is doing; Johnny Depp, whose comment “America is a broken toy” fits the work named after him;     Alexander the Great, a boat shape with a male mannequin standing on it; and Al Gore, a bulky rectangular pylon that looks like a mottled Monet painting.
The thermostat on Al Gore not only makes you think about his signature issue but also about what the temperature might be of his future, as well as the sculpture’s.
