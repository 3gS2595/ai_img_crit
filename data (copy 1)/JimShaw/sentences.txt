The main reason Jim Shaw’s 1991 Metro Pictures exhibition, “Thrift Store Paintings,” was one of the most important shows of the decade, other than that it brimmed with dementedly entertaining art, is that it unlocked the doors to scores of dead, forgotten, or otherwise devalued painting genres.
Although one of the most important shows of the last 15 years, Jim Shaw’s 1991 “Thrift Store Paintings” at Metro Pictures, also tinkered with the status quo, all the artists in it were anonymous amateurs, oddballs, and “outsiders”.
His patchwork composition portends artists like Rauschenberg, Polke, and Basquiat, while his intoxicated, comic book style and sexual imaginings predict everyone from Peter Saul and Jim Shaw to Amy Sillman and Carroll Dunham.
Add to this a whiff of Thomas Hart Benton, superhero comics, Popular Science magazine, women’s prison films, World War II illustration, lesser-known surrealists like Leonora Carrington and Leonor Fini, and affinities with contemporaries like Tim Gardner and Jim Shaw, and you’ve got a genuinely oddball mix.
From the abject installations of Karen Kilimnik and Mike Kelley, to the realistic paintings and sculptures of Eric Fischl, Amy Adler, Jim Shaw, and Robert Gober, to the diaristic photographs of Wolfgang Tillmans, Nan Goldin, and Richard Billingham, artists have contemplated their origins, the subcultures of youth, and coming-of-age.
Mike Kelley, Tony Oursler, and Jim Shaw belong to this brotherhood, as do Stephen Prina, David Robbins, and Christopher Williams.
Probably made artists like Jim Shaw, Sue Williams, and Karen     Kilimnik possible.
Unlike fellow Californians Jim Shaw, who simply collected thrift-store paintings and displayed them, or Mike Kelley, who used cast-off stuffed animals in his art, Grotjahn puts his obsession through an extraordinary transformation so that we don’t know if the final object is art, a doppelgänger, an original, a copy, a hoax, or bad politics.
Magpie-eyed artist Jim Shaw has spent most of his career in the shadows of his good friends and colleagues Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy.
