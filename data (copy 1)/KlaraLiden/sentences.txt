Klara Liden’s current stripped-down installation at Reena Spaulings involving huts, houses, and beds, as well as videos of her doing weird things, would seem to fit too neatly into this category.
Plus, the additions of Anne Collier and Bernadette Corporation after that, and real-unreal-looking photos by Annette Kelm, and Laura Owens’s impressive flunky paintings, Alex Israel’s self-portrait painting-as-logo, and a number of Klara Liden pieces, including a handmade bench that rests on bundled cardboard boxes and doubles as a slide-projecting sculpture — all of these might lure viewers in for years to come.

Klara Liden, It’s Complicated Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 165 East Broadway Through Dec.
7 For about a decade now, Klara Liden has specialized in stripped-down, odious-sublime, jackal-in-the-night installations involving huts, houses, old posters, beds, videos of her smashing abandoned apartments, moonwalking along the West Side Highway, or, in her current haunted outing at Reena Spaulings, one of the strangest videos I’ve ever seen.
You enter Klara Liden’s portentous cemetery of trees and wintry imminence through a small door in a police-barricade-blue plywood wall.

The emblem for the show may be Klara Liden’s dark alcove with its upside-down spinning model of the New Museum overhead and a video of the artist moonwalking through the city at night.
Or the way that Klara Liden has walked in circles around a bicycle in an empty room before going at it with a crowbar; somehow you get the absurdity, anger, and the frustration of this urban self-attack.
