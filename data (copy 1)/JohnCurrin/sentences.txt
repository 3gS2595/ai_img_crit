Around 1998, John Currin began his rise to the top of every collector’s wish list and commenced his descent into slick, fussy, quasi–Northern Renaissance academicism.
Like her colleague John Currin—who is often compared to Botticelli, Cranach, and Dürer—Yuskavage, who has been likened unto Vermeer, Raphael, and Bellini, is a solid painter.

Dorothy’s three traveling companions are a hobo-like Brice Marden as the Scarecrow, John Currin as the Tin Man, and Bert Lahr look-alike Jasper Johns as the Cowardly Lion (Julian Schnabel supposedly turned down the part at the last minute).
Echoing Kim Levin’s infamous 1993 “boycott John Currin” condemnation, a well-known critic told me that she had been so “offended” and “disgusted” by Ben-Tor’s mocking Holocaust performance that she had reached her “walk out moment” (a great phrase).
Luckily, the cops didn’t arrest or confiscate the small “bootleg paintings” that Doeringer makes and sells for around $100 each—copies of such Chelsea stalwarts as John Currin and Lisa Yuskav-age (full disclosure: I own a Doeringer Damian Hirst dot painting and a Christopher Wool).

If nothing else, it made the realism, eccentricities, subject choices, and painterly styles of artists as diverse as Karen Kilimnik, Elizabeth Peyton, Laura Owens, Sean Landers, Lisa Yuskavage, and John Currin—all of whom were just beginning to show—make more sense than they might have otherwise.
Ditto Laura Owens, who approaches every drawing as an occasion to rethink drawing; Neo Rauch, whose works on paper aren’t that different from his paintings but are so good it doesn’t matter; Barry McGee’s turbocharged wall of drawings; Franz Ackermann’s 34 studies of a walk through Pittsburgh (with provocative titles like Cinema Beirut and Former Trade Center); John Currin, not because his drawings are so good but because they’re so weird; and Elizabeth Peyton, whose drawings aren’t as juicy as her paintings but are still captivating.

To cheesecake, beefcake, and calendar art; Maxfield Parrish, Norman Rockwell, and Vargas; nudist magazine photography, the kind of kitsch the Nazis revered; and, although his art is more unsettling, subversive, and concentrated, perhaps even to John Currin, who flirts with the conservative side of painting, and who once brilliantly described Moby Dick as “the biggest nude in the universe”.
Artists like John Currin and Lisa Yuskavage also work figuratively and are earnest about what they paint, but they’re in an ongoing conversation with the ways and means of the avant-garde, and are more engaged in overturning and undermining clichés.

Perhaps none more than Michelangelo: Just consider, for instance, the ways that he sneaks in humongous giantesses into this Christian scenario, or the way that Michelangelo’s acrid floral coloring in this massive painting changes art history, filtering down to us not only through the genius of Pontormo, Parmigianino, and Bronzino, but from Ensor to the Expressionists all the way to artists like Lisa Yuskavage and John Currin — and is thousands of thankful miles from all of Leonardo’s brown.

Shaw’s activities can be seen to presage artists like John Currin, Elizabeth Peyton, Lisa Yuskavage, Karen Kilimnik, Sean Landers, and others — all of whom explored then-unused visual painterly information.

Martin glides in slo-mo past art featured in the sale: work by Christopher Wool, Wade Guyton, Richard Prince, Jeff Koons, Dan Colen, Cady Noland, John Currin, and other blue-chip names.
“Bound 2” is certainly a piece of work — as bizarrely gonzo and creepily asexual as Jeff Koons’s hyperrealistic 1991 paintings of himself having sex with his then-wife Cicciolina, John Currin’s 1989 paintings of Breck girls, and Marina Abramovic’s staring at spectators at MoMA in 2010.
