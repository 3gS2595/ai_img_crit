For the “up” part, before the first Kreps outing, he made colorful hand-painted signs that said things like “Don’t Steal My Car Stereo, I’m Queer,” “I slept with Martin Kippenberger,” and “Knock knock.
The sewn paintings are beautiful, although they evoke similar efforts by Sigmar Polke, Martin Kippenberger, and Rosemarie Trockel.
DandyOne of the current ringleaders in the irony department is Michael Krebber, the Cologne-born and-based 52-year-old who studied with German neo-expressionist artist-as-dandy Marcus Lupertz and who was an assistant to both Georg Baselitz and to that super-imp of the perverse, the late Martin Kippenberger.

Paul McCarthy, Martin Kippenberger and Jorg Immendorf each turn up twice.
Recent male mess makers include Jason Rhoades, Damien Hirst, Keith Tyson, John Bock, Jonathan Meese, Aidas Bareikis, Thomas Hirschhorn, the late Dieter Roth and Martin Kippenberger, and the living overlord, Paul McCarthy.
Gary Hume, Robert Melee, Martin Kippenberger, Olaf Breuning, Paul McCarthy, Tracey Emin, and Damien Hirst fit this mold.
Both paintings are comical, but the former is unresolved and the latter is too close to work by Jorg Immendorf and Martin Kippenberger.
All of them have retrieved a trace of the elusive, unstrung Martin Kippenberger gene and have forsaken fussiness.
I’d add the maharishi Martin Kippenberger, except he lacks the crucial paranoid component.
The subgenre known as “the exhibition space as art” stretches from Duchamp’s Mile of String and Schwitters’s Merzbau, through Dali, Kienholz, Christo, Kaprow, Samaras, and Segal, goes crazy with Dieter Roth and “Grandmaster” Martin Kippenberger, and crests with the almost all-boy band of Pardo, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Tobias Rehberger, Carsten Holler, and the fabulous Björk-like backup stylings of Lily van der Stokker—call them Rirkrit and the Family Tiravanija.
Fashionable faves like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Martin Kippenberger are in; Philip Taaffe, Sarah Charlesworth, and Allan McCollum are out.
Now I see Barney as a mystic bridge between the ambition, absurdity, first-person identity politics, and pseudo-autobiographical Arabian Nights fiction of 1980s artists like Cindy Sherman, Robert Gober, Anselm Kiefer, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Martin Kippenberger and the populism, love of beauty, craft, dexterity with scales large and small, unusual materials, and grand activism of 1990s artists like Kara Walker, Pipilotti Rist, Olafur Eliasson, Thomas Hirschhorn, later Robert Gober, and even Richard Serra — who actually appeared in one of Barney’s films.
) In “Thrift Store Paintings,” Shaw followed in the footsteps of greats like Duchamp, Picabia, Enrico Baj, Asger Jorn, and Jean Dubuffet, and, closer to the present, Martin Kippenberger, Mike Kelley, and others who either altered ready-made paintings, presented them as unmediated material that needed to be seen, or just went and commissioned paintings by others (pace Kippenberger and John Baldessari).
As a long-time assistant to the late, great Martin Kippenberger, his art was thought to have Kippenberger-esque cred, attitude, and style — sort of like the way the children of celebrities can be seen sooner as stars.
The show needed more space, even if it meant spilling onto another floor, as the Gerhard Richter and Martin Kippenberger shows did.

) Seth Price’s glossy paintings with rope look like a slick cross between Martin Kippenberger and Marcel Broodthaers, ready-made for critics who also love parsing out the isms of their elders.
Painting was being reborn in Germany, a rebirth that is roaring to this day, where his influences are visible in artists as disparate as Albert Oehlen, Neo Rauch, Anselm Kiefer, Rosemarie Trockel, and the late Martin Kippenberger and Jorge Immendorff.
Midway through “Martin Kippenberger: The Problem Perspective,” a show I expected to be good but uneven, I found myself stunned.
The Problem Perspective           Martin Kippenberger.
But the materials, abjectness, and jokiness feel indebted to Martin Kippenberger and Mike Kelley, and end up being pointless.

But the materials, abjectness and jokiness feel indebted to Martin Kippenberger and Mike Kelley, and end up being pointless.
Especially anti-alchemical is a room devoted to the dead, a cemetery of artists who cant defend themselves, among them, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Martin Kippenberger, Chen Zhen and Fred Sandback.
