This connects Faunce to an all-male, hyper-skilled wing of contemporary art that includes such artists as Twitchell (whose dazzling new paper-cutout paintings are on view at Greenberg Van Doren), Edwards, Lari Pittman, Ashley Bickerton, Fred Tomaselli, Simon Periton, and Takashi Murakami.
Some of the better artists representing this phase include Jeff Koons, Ashley Bickerton, Richard Prince, and the late Gretchen Bender.
Ashley Bickerton has been spending time there as well, drawing a couple of wicked caricatures on the walls.
