This survey within a show contains excellent artists, including Dana Schutz, Mika Rottenberg, Laleh Khorramian, Jamie Isenstein, Guy Ben-ner (who will represent Israel in this summer’s Venice Biennale), and Banks Violette (who looks as good here as he ever has.
Brock Enright’s kidnapping piece is incredibly annoying but intense; Cameron Jamie is better than this work indicates; ditto Bjarne Melgaard; Matt     Greene’s Spanish-moss-like paintings are overly familiar and underdeveloped; and I’m still trying to figure out if Banks Violette is more than a latter-day Robert Longo.
